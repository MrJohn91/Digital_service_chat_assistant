      "Answer: If you've recently upgraded to Premium, but that doesn't seem to reflect in the app, it's important to first assess the situation. Do you hear ads during music playback? Spoiler (Highlight to read) Premium allows you to listen to music uninterrupted by ads, but some podcasts may still include advertising, host-read endorsements, or sponsorship messages. If you're hearing these while listening to podcasts, that is expected.

If your songs are still shuffled, try toggling the mode off by simply tapping the Shuffle icon again in the Now playing view or the three dots context menu. More info can be found in this article .

      "In case you're unable to toggle off Shuffle mode, then you're probably logged in to a free account instead. See the section How can I check which account I'm currently logged in? on how to ensure you're logged in correctly. How can I check which account I'm currently logged in? On mobile , you can do that by going to the app's Settings (you can access them by going to your profile picture in the top left corner and then tapping the Settings and privacy gear icon). On the top of the Settings page you'll see your subscription status. If you're on a PC/Mac you can click on your name in the upper-right corner > Account which will directly open up the account page for the currently logged in account. On this page you can see detailed information about your account, including your plan's current status. On mobile, the account page can be accessed by visiting the following URL in your browser: https://spotify.com/account/overview/, but you might need to log in manually. If your account shows as free account in the app's Settings, but Your plan on your account page shows as Spotify Premium , it's recommended that you sign out and back into the app using the same login details you used for your account page to ensure that you're logged in to the Premium account. If Your plan also shows as Spotify free , then either your payment didn't go through or you most likely you signed up for Premium on another account. Check if you received a receipt  on your email when you signed up. If you didn't then it's worth trying to subscribe again. If  you did receive a receipt, there you'll find the username of the Premium account, a unique string of numbers and letters used to identify you on Spotify. Copy it and use it together with your password to log in. Should you need to reset your password, you can follow the steps in this article . Tip: At the bottom of every email sent by Spotify you'll also find the recipient's email address, so you can use the information to double-check if you were entering the correct email address during the login process. Keep in mind that it's also possible that you created your Premium account either through Facebook, Google or Apple, so check those alternatives as well. For more info and tips about why your Premium subscription might not be working, check out this article . Didn't help? Search for more Spotify FAQs, or create a new thread and ask the Community.

      "Answer: Answer: If you've already received a message from SheerID confirming your student status, but you're having difficulties activating the discount, we first recommend trying to open the link from that message in an incognito or private window , preferably on a desktop device.

      "Question: What is Premium Duo and how does it work?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Premium Duo is a discount subscription for two people living together. Each person on the plan gets their own Premium account, so no one shares a password and everyone keeps their own saved music and playlists. If you're interested in sharing your subscription with more than one person, you can check out our Family plan. More info about it can be found here. How to use Premium Duo as a manager? The Premium Duo manager is the member who signs up for the plan and gets charged by Spotify on a monthly basis. The manager can also invite or remove members by logging in to their account page . Note: You can’t change the plan manager once they’ve signed up. How to use Premium Duo as a member? To accept an invite to someone else's plan, you must live with the plan manager, log into (or sign up for) your own account and enter the correct address. How does the billing work? Spotify only charges the plan manager, never the invited member. If you see unexpected charges, you can check the guide for finding any additional accounts . The full amount will be charged monthly, regardless of whether the other member joins. If you've already subscribed to Premium with Spotify, your billing will switch automatically and you won’t need to cancel anything. Your new payment date will likely be a few days earlier than usual to cover the price difference between Premium Individual and Premium Duo. Changing the address If you move or the wrong details were entered at signup, the plan manager can change the address by logging in to their account page . The other member on the plan may be asked to confirm the new address to continue using the plan. You can switch between different Duo plans, but only once in 12 months. If you try switching more than once, you’ll get an error message saying You can’t join this plan . If the plan manager switches between Duo and Family, this doesn’t affect the invited members and is considered the same plan. The 12 months start counting from the first time you switch plans.

      "Question: 1-Month Free Premium offer\n",
      "Answer: We get that users want to explore all of Premium’s unique features at no cost before committing to a recurring plan. That’s why we offer a 1-month free trial to anyone who has never tested Premium before. During your free trial period, you’ll get the full Premium experience of your choosing, just like any other paid subscriber would.

Good to know You can get 1-month free for any available plan in your country It's possible to switch to a different Premium plan during the trial, however this will most likely cancel your trial and your account will get charged for the new plan (unless additional T&C are present for the trial in question) At the end of the 1-month free, your account will automatically roll on to a monthly paid subscription for the product you've signed up for You can cancel anytime during your trial period if you don’t want to be charged Gift cards can't be used to activate the 1-month free offer Who's eligible for this offer? Anyone who hasn't yet had Premium on their account, previously signed up for a trial or used the same payment details on another account. Not available for Family or Duo plans. If you see this message on the checkout page, it means you're not eligible for the offer: If you can’t remember having Premium, check out your receipts page or search your email inboxes for any previous emails from us. Other offers to look out for In addition to the 1-Month Free offer, which is available all the time, we’re having special deals regularly where you can get Premium for a fraction of the regular price, or even free, for a specified time.

The Premium Family manager is the member who signs up for the plan and gets charged by Spotify on a monthly basis. The manager can also invite or remove members by logging in to their Family page . How to use Premium Family as a member? Members can join a Family plan once the manager have sent them an invite. To accept the invite, you must live at the same address as the plan manager, make sure you're logged in to your own Spotify account and provide the correct address by either using location services or entering it manually. How does the billing work? Spotify only charges the plan manager, never the invited members. If you see unexpected charges, you can check our guide for finding any additional accounts . The full amount is being charged monthly, regardless of if members join. If you've already subscribed for Premium with us, your billing will switch automatically and you won’t need to cancel anything. If you subscribed to Premium before becoming a member of a Family plan, your plan will be automatically cancelled once you join. As mentioned above, the manager will be the only one charged for the Family plan. Keep in mind that if your current Premium plan is associated with a partner, you first need to cancel with them and wait for your current Premium to end. What features does the plan offer? Change address . If you move or the wrong details were entered at signup, the plan manager can change the address by logging in to their Family page . Existing members may be asked to confirm the new address to continue using the plan. Blend - which offers users a similar experience to the features of the now deprecated Family mix but with expanded capabilities, including an unlimited number of playlists and up to 10 different participants on each. Manage explicit content . The plan manager can choose to allow or block content marked as explicit for each member of the plan. Keep in mind that our explicit tags are based on information we receive from the rights-holders. It’s possible some explicit content may not be tagged, so won’t be blocked from playing with these steps. Users can switch between different Premium Family or Premium Duo plans, but only once in 12 months. If you try switching more than once, you’ll get an error message saying You can’t join this plan . If the plan manager decides to switch between Family and/or Duo, this doesn’t affect the invited members and is considered the same plan. The 12 months start counting from the first time a user switched plans. Didn't help? Search for more Spotify Answers, or create a new thread and ask the Community.

      "Question: Verify your Premium Family/Duo address\n",
      "Answer: The plan’s manager (the person who signs up for Premium Family or Duo ) needs to enter their address at signup. After receiving an invite to join the plan, each plan member then has to enter the exact same address to be added to the plan. FAQ Q: How can I check the address I’ve registered on my Premium Family/Duo account? A: If you’re the manager of a Family or Duo plan, you can view and update the address you registered from your Spotify Account page here . If you’re a member of the plan, you won’t be able to see the address. You can reach out to the manager of your plan for assistance. Q: Can I change the address registered on my Premium Family/Duo account? A: If you move, or the wrong details were entered at signup, the plan’s manager can change the address by going to their Spotify Account page’s Family or Duo subscription tab here . Q: What to do if my address is not listed? A: If your address doesn't autocomplete, enter the entire address, then select Find . If you still can’t find it, select your building, street name, or a close public space or building. Just don't use someone else's address. Didn't help?

      "Question: Can I upgrade to Premium for Family or a Duo plan if I'm travelling abroad?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: All members of a Premium for Family or Duo plan must reside at the same physical address. Unfortunately, if you are currently travelling abroad and want to start one of those plans and invite members, it won't be possible. However, you can start your own plan as soon as you return home and send out invites for your friends and family to join. Alternatively, you can join someone else’s plan as soon as you return home.

      "Answer: Unfortunately you can't combine these deals, so it's not possible to add Hulu to Premium Family or Duo. If you have an active Premium subscription involving Hulu and upgrade to either Family or Duo , you will loose access to the Hulu bundle and won't be able to activate it again unless you're eligible for the Student discount - head here for more info on that.

      "Question: Premium Family/Duo: only one person can listen at a time\n",
      "Answer: Each plan member needs to log in to their own Spotify account on their chosen device to listen. This means everyone gets their own playlists and saved music, and you don’t have to take turns or share login details. If you can't listen at the same time, someone's logged into the wrong account. They need to log out , then back in using the email address they used to join the plan. If you're the plan's manager (the person who started the plan) and your members haven't joined your plan from their own Spotify account yet, you'll need to follow the steps below: Go to the Family page / Duo page . On that page you can see an invite link to share with the person you want to add to your plan. There a several methods to choose from to share the invite link - just pick your preferred one. Invited members get a link to join, where they need to log in to their own account and verify their address . Tip : If they're accepting the invite on the same device it was sent from, the plan's manager who sent the invite should make sure they've logged out of their account first. If they didn't sign up for a Spotify account yet, they'll get prompted to make one when going through the steps once they click ACCEPT INVITE .

      "Question: Can I get Premium Family or Duo if I'm on an annual subscription?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Yes! You can start or join a Premium Family or Premium Duo plan right away, provided that your subscription was set up through Spotify directly. If you'd like to join a plan as a member , you can ask the plan's owner to send you an invitation  first. Once you join their plan, future payments will switch to the plan owner. Any remaining Premium time you have is forfeited. Further, if you want to start your own Premium Family or Duo plan and invite members, you also can! Keep in mind though that your next payment date will likely be earlier than it had been, due to the price difference between the plans. Didn't help?

      "Question: Why has my Premium subscription changed to free?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: The most common reason for your Premium subscription suddenly disappearing is due to having a second Spotify account created using Facebook. The best thing to try is logging out of Spotify, then back in using your email address and password. Avoid using the ‘Log in with Facebook’ button, as this will log you back into your Facebook-created account. If this works and you’re now seeing your Premium account, it’s worth closing your free account to avoid any confusion in the future. To confirm, you should see this (the Spotify Premium box under \"Your Plan\") in your Account overview if you're on Premium: If you’ve subscribed recently but you’re not get Premium, check out this Spotify Answer .

      "Question: Sunsetting older app versions\n",
      "Answer: Hey folks, Starting January 15th, 2022, Spotify application versions that have been released before 2017 will no longer be supported. As a result, users who were still using the older versions of the application will not be able to log in to their accounts unless they upgrade to the latest Spotify app version. Spotify application versions from prior to 2017 on Android, iOS and desktop were missing certain features due to their outdated interface, and we made the decision to stop supporting them. If you were affected by this you will be receiving an email from us soon regarding this change. Affected users should update their Spotify to the latest version to keep using Spotify. Alternatively, you can use the Spotify Web Player from your supported web browser . For additional assistance or questions, please reach out to our Customer Support or visit our Support site .

Scroll down to the Local Files option and toggle on Show audio files from this device . Note: A pop-up will ask permission to access your local network. Press OK to enable the transferring of local files between your PC and your iPhone/iPad. You can find this option in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network > Spotify in case you accidentally dismiss the pop-up or if it doesn't show up. Now go back to Your Library and download your playlist: the local files in it will sync over from your PC to your iPhone/iPad! Note: Local files sync is possible in some cases, but we cannot guarantee that it will work flawlessly across all devices. Local files discovery Play the audio files stored on your device and add them to your personal playlists! In order for the app to discover them, your files need to be added to the Spotify folder located in Files > On My iPhone/iPad . If you can't find the folder there, reboot your device and it should show up. Here are a few ways to upload them there: For Mac: Make sure that Show audio files from this device is toggled on in the app's Settings > Your Library > Show Local files (add your library) , and Spotify is allowed to access Media & Apple Music .

      "Question: Shazam and Spotify\n",
      "Answer: Answer: As of writing this in March 2021, Shazam have released an updated version of their app for iOS, which as of version 14.2 has new features and functionalities. We wanted to share some info that we hope will clear up some questions and that you might find useful to get the best out of both apps. Can I connect Shazam to Spotify and how do I do that? The two apps can be connected so that you can get some extra benefits if using them together. In the Shazam app, go to Settings (available from Library ) and tap Connect . You'll need to authorize Spotify access to Shazam and you're done! Note: The Connect option is only shown in countries where Spotify is available. How do I automatically add my shazamed tracks to a Spotify playlist? Once connected, a playlist labeled My Shazam Tracks will be created in Spotify and all your subsequent Shazamed content will be automatically added. How do I add my Shazamed songs to other Spotify playlists? Tapping the Spotify Open button on any song in Shazam will open a search in Spotify and show you all the versions of that song. From there you can add the version of your choice to any Spotify playlist. Why can’t I connect Spotify to Shazam? / Why is there only Apple Music showing and not Spotify? The Connect option in the Shazam Settings will only be displayed in countries where Spotify is available. If you can't see the Spotify option on song pages in Shazam, go to Shazam Settings and make sure you’re connected. If you're having problems opening or syncing to Spotify, try disconnecting Spotify in Shazam Settings , restart both apps and then reconnect. Why wasn’t a 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist created when I turned on Sync? A playlist may fail to be created due to connection issues. Next time you Shazam a track we'll try and create the playlist again, and will add your latest Shazamed contents. Why wasn’t my latest shazamed track added to the 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist? There may've been a connection issue. When you next shazam a song, the playlist should update with your latest Shazams. If the issue persists, try the following steps: Make sure you're on the latest version of Shazam and Spotify Disconnect from Spotify in Shazam Settings Restart both apps Reconnect to Spotify I removed the \"My Shazam Tracks\" playlist. How can I get the tracks back? If you delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlists and then shazam a new track while connected to Spotify, a new playlist will be created. This overwrites the previous one and previous Shazams won't be re-added. As such, we advise not to delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlist, unless you want to move the existing tracks to other playlists and have already done so. What happens when I rename the My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify? If the My Shazam Tracks playlist is renamed while Sync Shazams to Spotify is turned on, a new My Shazam Tracks playlist will be created on your next Shazam. Any Shazams from that point onwards will be added to this newly created playlist. Where is the Add To button in Shazam? Following version 14.2 of Shazam, the Add To button has been removed, however the Open button has been improved with a more reliable search in Spotify. This means you can now add the song version of choice to any playlist in Spotify. Alternatively, if you want your new Shazams to be automatically added to a My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify, there's the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature.. Why are my past Shazams no longer syncing? Past Shazams will no longer sync to Spotify as part of the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature, however the syncing overall has been improved so you shouldn't have any issues to find and add more of your future Shazams to the My Shazam Tracks playlist. What about Shazam on Android? The new features and improved syncing are now available on the Android and iOS version of the app. Happy Shazaming! Didn't help?

      "Question: Manage Liked Songs\n",
      "Answer: Answer: When thinking of the ways to manage your Liked Songs , one of the most straightforward ideas would be to use the available Sort and Filter options. On the one hand, you can sort your Liked Songs according to each featured song’s title, artist, album, date (in terms of when it was added to the playlist), and duration. On the other hand, by using the option to filter, you can look up specific songs you might want to listen to without waiting for them to be eventually played as part of your queue. What is not as straightforward (and often overlooked) is the fact that, aside from using the Sort and Filter options separately, it’s possible to combine them . By doing so, you can manage your Liked Songs more efficiently and: Display all the songs from a particular artist in alphabetical order If you’d like to view and display all the songs from one specific artist in alphabetical order, tap Liked Songs > sort by Title > type the name of an artist in the search bar. Spot and remove duplicates If you sort your Liked Songs by Title and filter the results based on one artist’s name, all the “duplicates” (e.g. same audio with extremely similar or slightly different metadata) from the particular artist will also be displayed so you can remove them from the list.

How can I check which account I'm currently logged in? On mobile , you can do that by going to the app's Settings (you can access them by going to your profile picture in the top left corner and then tapping the Settings and privacy gear icon). On the top of the Settings page you'll see your subscription status. If you're on a PC/Mac you can click on your name in the upper-right corner > Account which will directly open up the account page for the currently logged in account. On this page you can see detailed information about your account, including your plan's current status. On mobile, the account page can be accessed by visiting the following URL in your browser: https://spotify.com/account/overview/, but you might need to log in manually. If your account shows as free account in the app's Settings, but Your plan on your account page shows as Spotify Premium , it's recommended that you sign out and back into the app using the same login details you used for your account page to ensure that you're logged in to the Premium account. If Your plan also shows as Spotify free , then either your payment didn't go through or you most likely you signed up for Premium on another account. Check if you received a receipt  on your email when you signed up. If you didn't then it's worth trying to subscribe again. If  you did receive a receipt, there you'll find the username of the Premium account, a unique string of numbers and letters used to identify you on Spotify. Copy it and use it together with your password to log in. Should you need to reset your password, you can follow the steps in this article . Tip: At the bottom of every email sent by Spotify you'll also find the recipient's email address, so you can use the information to double-check if you were entering the correct email address during the login process.

      "Question: Premium Family/Duo: only one person can listen at a time\n",
      "Answer: Each plan member needs to log in to their own Spotify account on their chosen device to listen. This means everyone gets their own playlists and saved music, and you don’t have to take turns or share login details. If you can't listen at the same time, someone's logged into the wrong account. They need to log out , then back in using the email address they used to join the plan. If you're the plan's manager (the person who started the plan) and your members haven't joined your plan from their own Spotify account yet, you'll need to follow the steps below: Go to the Family page / Duo page . On that page you can see an invite link to share with the person you want to add to your plan. There a several methods to choose from to share the invite link - just pick your preferred one.

Tip : If they're accepting the invite on the same device it was sent from, the plan's manager who sent the invite should make sure they've logged out of their account first.

      "Question: Can I get Premium Family or Duo if I'm on an annual subscription?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Yes! You can start or join a Premium Family or Premium Duo plan right away, provided that your subscription was set up through Spotify directly. If you'd like to join a plan as a member , you can ask the plan's owner to send you an invitation  first. Once you join their plan, future payments will switch to the plan owner. Any remaining Premium time you have is forfeited. Further, if you want to start your own Premium Family or Duo plan and invite members, you also can! Keep in mind though that your next payment date will likely be earlier than it had been, due to the price difference between the plans. Didn't help?

      "Question: Why has my Premium subscription changed to free?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: The most common reason for your Premium subscription suddenly disappearing is due to having a second Spotify account created using Facebook. The best thing to try is logging out of Spotify, then back in using your email address and password. Avoid using the ‘Log in with Facebook’ button, as this will log you back into your Facebook-created account. If this works and you’re now seeing your Premium account, it’s worth closing your free account to avoid any confusion in the future. To confirm, you should see this (the Spotify Premium box under \"Your Plan\") in your Account overview if you're on Premium: If you’ve subscribed recently but you’re not get Premium, check out this Spotify Answer .

      "Question: Invoices for your Spotify Premium subscription\n",
      "Answer: As Spotify is for personal/non-commercial use, we only issue payment receipts. We don't issue invoices with a VAT number. However, we email a receipt to you at the beginning of your Premium trial, the first payment of a subscription, or when you purchase an e-card. You can also see a breakdown of the different taxes applied to your payment on that receipt. You should also receive email receipts for all your subsequent payments regardless of the subscription you use. If you haven’t received one, first make sure that you've provided the correct email address on your Account Overview page . Then, we'd suggest checking your spam/junk folder in case they were redirected there by mistake. If you still cannot find your receipts or if you cannot access them for other reasons (such as these being sent to a defunct address), you can also reach out to our support team and ask them to resend you all the receipts you need. You can always find your receipts on the part of the Subscription page here . Didn't help? Search for more Spotify Answers, or create a new thread and ask the Community.

      "Question: Why am I still being charged after cancelling my subscription?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: If you get a Spotify charge after canceling your subscription, follow these steps: Log in to your account page . Click Subscription in the menu on the left. If your subscription status is Free, you may have a second account with Spotify. It's worth checking your email inboxes to see if you have any Spotify emails - that can mean that your extra account is registered with that email. If you don't have another email address, note how you log into the Spotify app usually: If you use your Facebook details try using the blue \"Log in with Facebook button.\" If you use your Spotify username try entering your username or email address. Once you've logged in, try the cancel process again and ensure you reach the final confirmation screen. Tip: If you subscribed through any other company than Spotify (for example your mobile or broadband company), you need to contact that company to cancel. For more info, check out this article .

      "Question: Improvements to Spotify Xbox Game Bar for Windows\n",
      "Answer: Hey everyone! We want to let you know that the Windows Store version of Spotify for Windows 1.1.94 comes with its own Xbox Game Bar widget, seamlessly replacing the one you are used to. What's new? The new Xbox Game Bar widget is always logged in to the same Spotify account that Spotify for Windows is logged in to. This means you never need to log in separately, and changing who's logged in to Spotify for Windows is constantly reflected. To use the new Xbox Game Bar widget, you now always have to run Spotify for Windows on the same PC. It can however be minimized to the taskbar or even to the system tray if you select \"Close button should minimize the Spotify Window\" in Preferences. You can of course still play via Spotify Connect just like before. Several bugs in the general user experience were fixed. The new Xbox Game Bar widget now comes in additional languages. Why are we doing this? The new version makes logging in much easier. The new version is now shipped in tandem with Spotify for Windows on Microsoft Store, making it easier for us to ship further improvements to the experience. Anything else? If you used the Xbox Game Bar widget previously, you have granted it access to your account. This is no longer needed and you can now revoke it by pressing Remove Access on Xbox Game Bar here . FAQ: I see an error message telling me to install the Spotify Widget: Spotify needs to be installed from the Microsoft Store to include the Xbox Game Bar widget. If you previously had downloaded Spotify via spotify.com, you will still have your settings, downloaded music and podcasts available to you. I see two Spotify Widgets: We're aware of this but it should be a very temporary phenomenon. The old widget will disappear after a while. The widget is stuck on the 'Start listening' screen: The Desktop app needs to be running, clicking the “Start Listening” button will launch it. If you are not logged into the Desktop app you will need to login and then bring the Game Bar up again with the Windows + G key command. Labels: Device Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

You can check the “Voice History” under “Activity” in the Amazon Alexa app to check if she heard you correctly and leave feedback whether she did what you wanted to improve your Alexa experience. Another important thing to note is that you must use the exact name of the playlist you want. Things that are likely to cause issues are usually playlists that contain punctuation, emojis, acronyms and initialisms (e.g. NASA and BBC) or other words that are just difficult to pronounce. The easiest way to deal with those is to rename the playlist from within Spotify. Note that Alexa might not be able to open newly/recently created playlists, because it can take time for Alexa to refresh your library of playlists. If you want to force it to find your new playlist immediately, try unlinking your Spotify in the Alexa app and then re-linking it (as described above). This should refresh the list of available playlists.

How to deal with tricky playlist names Spoiler (Highlight to read) Naturally, you can only rename the playlists you created yourself - So, what about those playlists that you’re following, whose names you cannot edit? One way to deal with this is to make a copy of the playlist and give it an easy to pronounce name that Alexa can understand. Keep in mind that your copied playlist won’t get any new songs added to the original, followed playlist, so we know this isn’t ideal. You can also try to create an Alexa Routine that triggers playback of the desired playlist. Once you have your routine set up, you can simply say: “Alexa, playlist.” and the favorite one will start automatically. Of course, you can always go back to the routines section and edit your preferences or have multiple routines for different playlists.

Spoiler (Highlight to read) It’s currently not possible to link more than one Spotify account per Alexa account, but there’s a workaround that allows you to set up multiple Spotify accounts to work on your Alexa. You can add multiple accounts by setting up an Amazon Household . This way you can switch from one account to another just by talking to Alexa. For more details check out the related Amazon Help Topic here . Note that everyone who intends to use it will need to set up their own account with Amazon which in turn has to be linked to their own Spotify account using their own version of the app. Alternatively, you can use Spotify Connect without having to link your accounts, but if you don’t, you won’t have the full functionality of Alexa’s commands either and you'll have to use the Spotify app to choose your music. To do this, say \"Alexa, Spotify Connect\" to the specific speaker you want to listen to music on and follow the instructions that Alexa gives you (Open Spotify on your phone and select the playback device from the list). This allows you to play music from separate Spotify accounts on different speakers at the same time. Tip: It’s best to keep Spotify closed when you use the \"Spotify Connect\" command, then open Spotify when she tells you to. If you don't, the connection between Spotify app and your speaker isn't always made.

      "Answer: Answer: Power off your device It might sound basic, but some people over look this, and it can definitely help in some instances. To power off your PlayStation: Select the Power on/off button from the function screen, and then select Turn Off PS4/PS5. Press and hold the PS button on your controller for at least 1 second, and then select Turn Off PS4/PS5. Press and hold the power button for at least 7 seconds (until the system beeps twice). We’d also recommend unplugging your device and waiting for a few minutes before powering up again. Sign out of the PlayStation Network If you’re signed into the PlayStation Network, try signing out/back in again. Select Settings > PlayStation™Network/Account management > Sign Out. To sign back in, select Settings > PlayStation™Network/Account management > Sign In. Reinstall the app To reinstall the app on your device, find PlayStation Music featuring Spotify in your start up menu and select OPTIONS [on your PS controller] > Delete.

      "Question: Finding login details\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Not sure of your ID or you need a reminder of which email you used? Need those so you can reset your password ? There are different steps that you can follow in order to find your ID. The same goes for finding the email address on your account. Please note that a public display name is not the same as your ID. Newer Spotify accounts will also have unique, automatically generated IDs, rather than personally chosen usernames. This is also true if you've created your account through Facebook. Using the Spotify website or emails If you are already logged in on your browser, the easiest way is to head to your Account Overview page. Under \"Account\", go to \"Edit profile\". There you can find both your username along with the email address that is associated with your Spotify account. If your login session has ran out, another way is to check your email inbox for an email from Spotify. You receive emails from us on account creation, on payment or subscription changes or due to other important notifications. There should be information to which email address it was sent to at the bottom of the email body. Using the mobile app Open the app and click your profile picture at the top left of the screen. On the Settings and privacy button you can find different options that you can turn on and off as well as your associated email address. You can use that to reset your password if you don't know it, so you can find out your unique user ID on your profile page, as described above. But what if I can't access my account page or am not logged in? No worries, the below methods can still work, even if you're not logged in anywhere on Spotify. You might need the help of another friend who can perform a search on Spotify though. Using profile links With the help from a friend or a family member's account, you can search for your name in the app and you can get a link that includes your ID. On Desktop Find your profile via search and click on the three-dots menu in the top right corner. Then you can click on Copy link to profile . When you paste the link, the part that comes after \" user/ \" and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. In our example the link looks like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \", but take note that this can be just an auto generated ID. For example, for profile: https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e, the ID is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". On Mobile Same as on desktop, find your profile via the search function. Click on the three dot menu in the right corner and choose Share . When you copy and paste the link, the part that comes after \" user/ \" and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. As with our example for desktop, the link will look like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \". If you have an auto-generated ID, the link will look  like: https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e , and the ID here is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". Using the cache files on a PC, Mac or Android device This method can be handy if you're using one of the below devices and haven't deleted any temporary files yet. Windows Navigate to the folder C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\Roaming. A quick way to do so is to type in %AppData% (Percentage symbols included) in the search bar of your start menu/taskbar and press Enter. Look for a Spotify folder. If you find it, open it up. You should see a subfolder \"Users\" in there. In that folder will be all the usernames that you've logged in with on this device. Sometimes, the folders could be located in C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\ Local . If that's the case, just, navigate one folder up from Roaming and switch to the Local folder. Then repeat step 2. Mac Open Finder on your Mac. Click Go > Library in the menu bar. (You may need to hold the Alt key if Library isn't visible.) Open Application Support > Spotify > Users. Here you’ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. Android Connect your phone to a computer with a USB cable. Alternatively, you can use a file manager on your phone. Find and open the directory Android > data > com.spotify.music > files > spotifycache > users. Here you’ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. If you still can't find the username or the email address after giving these steps a go, you can reach out to our support team. The folks there will be happy to assist with further help. Didn't help?

      "Question: Email Verification FAQ\n",
      "Answer: We'd like to share some useful info and provide some help regarding the verification emails you've received. In essence, you will be prompted to send an email to yourself so that you can open it and successfully conclude the verification to continue using your Spotify app. The process looks like this : You will see in-app prompts with a button and a link which you can click on to send yourself the verification email. The email address which the verification email will be sent to will be displayed in the prompt. There is also an option to edit the email address if needed. Here's what you can do if you encounter any issues: I use an old email and can't access my email address. If you know your Spotify password you can still update your email from your account page , even if you get blocked as part of the process. After updating it, you'll automatically receive a new verification email to the new address. Click on the link there and you're good! My registered Spotify email is no longer valid. What should I do now? You can edit the email address the verification is sent to from the prompts you receive. Just click the Edit email address button. Once a new email has been saved, the verification email will be sent. I got blocked. I want to update my email address and verify the new one. Can I do it on a PC/Mac? Yes, you can still update your email address from any browser by going to your account overview page and clicking Edit Profile. This will re-send a verification email, so you can verify. I never received the verification email. What is going on? This could be due to a couple of reasons: 1) Emails from Spotify are blocked by your email provider. We suggest switching your email like described above to an alternative one, from another provider. 2) You have a filter set up that is automatically hiding the email. T ry adjusting these filters. If you have a Gmail account, this can be done as follows: Open Gmail (best on a PC/Mac). At the top right, click Settings (the gear icon) > See all settings > Click Filters and Blocked Addresses > Check if Spotify is listed.

      "Question: Solve the \"Email is taken\" Issue\n",
      "Answer: Answer Sometimes, when trying to update settings (country, birth date etc.) on your Spotify account page, you might get an error message saying \"Email is taken.\" even if you didn't try to update your email address. If you did try to update your email but you're getting that message, I'd recommend you try following the \"Another account is using my email address\" section of this support article . However, sometimes you might get this message even if you didn't try to update your email address. This issue happens because a few years ago it was possible to create more than one account with the same email address, so if you have two accounts with the same email address, you won't be able to change it back because there would still be an account with that email address. To solve this issue, you can change the email address to a different one. However, if you'd like to change the email address back to the desired one, I'd recommend you try to do a password reset with the \"taken\" email address that you don't use and close any account that might pop up. That should enable you to change the email address back to the desired one. It's important to check the account you're closing is not the one you currently use. This should help clear things up! However, if you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask other users in the help boards . Labels: Account Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

      "Question: Find out if you have another Spotify account\n",
      "Answer: It's very easy to register for a Spotify account. Missing playlists or music from your account? Seeing charges for your Premium but when you log in, your account is on free? I f you're having troubles like these, we'd recommend first taking a look for any additional accounts you may have with us. It's possible your missing playlists or subscription are in there 🙂 There are several ways you can use to locate a Spotify account: 1. Check your email addresses Enter any email addresses you use into our password reset form . If there's an account associated with it, we’ll let you know in your email inbox. Tip: you can look for an email with the subject “Reset your password” and then follow the steps to recover your account . Check your email inboxes, including any spam or junk folders, for emails from Spotify. If you have any, it’s likely there’s an account associated with that email address. Once you've checked your email addresses and found any of the above, you can use that email address to log in. If you aren't sure of your account's password, continue to reset the account’s password , then use that email address and the new password to log in. 2. Check Facebook It's also possible to register for a Spotify account using your Facebook credentials. To check if you have a Spotify account connected to Facebook: Log into Facebook and select Settings on the dropdown in the top-right. Choose Apps and Websites . If you see the Spotify icon, you have a Spotify account connected to Facebook. If you find Spotify listed in your apps, you can access that Spotify account by choosing LOG IN WITH FACEBOOK in the login page. If you'd like to go on using Spotify without Facebook or have deactivated Facebook, we'd suggest taking a look at this Spotify Answer for more info. Keep in mind that you can also sign up for Spotify using a phone number, Apple , or Google . Try logging in to the account page with these options. 3.

      "Question: Numeric/Alphanumeric usernames\n",
      "Answer: A lot of users have an account created via Facebook. It's fast, it's easy and it doesn't require a lot of steps because the required info to sign up for a Spotify account is being read from the Facebook profile used when signing up. The most important info being: Your Facebook display name Facebook profile picture And your Facebook Friends It's possible to sign up for an account with your Facebook profile, and at a later stage to opt out from sharing your Facebook information with us. This will result in some changes in your Spotify account, most notably the following: Your display name will change into your alphanumeric username Your profile picture won't be visible on your Spotify account You won't be able to find Facebook friends on Spotify Note that these changes don't necessarily happen instantly as the Facebook synchronization can take up to 48 hours. Keep in mind that you can set up a new display name at any point using this guide. This is the name that your friends will see and which can be used to search for your profile. You can't however log in to the app with your display name. You will have to enter either your username or your registered email address next time you log in. If you add a new Spotify display name while your account is still connected to Facebook, it will replace your Facebook name. If you'd like to see your name and profile picture in Spotify again, you can l og in on our website and go to Privacy Settings . Check if you have opted out of Spotify processing your Facebook data. Be sure that you have not opted out if you want to have your name and profile picture visible in Spotify. It should look like this: On Facebooks end it's also possible to prevent certain info from being shared with Spotify. So if you've opted back in but certain info, for example your list with Facebook friends is still missing, log in here and find Spotify in the list with apps. Click on 'View and edit' and you'll get the following screen: In this screen you can further decide which information you'd like to share with Spotify. Once again, keep in mind that it can take up to 48 hours before changes take effect. You might need to log out and back in as well. Didn't help?

      "Question: Close/delete your Spotify Account\n",
      "Answer: Maybe you have a duplicate account, maybe you just need a break from Spotify or you want to start fresh with a new account? No hard feelings! In case you just want to stop paying, you can cancel your Premium plan and use Spotify free instead. If you don't have Premium you can close your account permanently yourself. Just log in here and continue through the steps. Keep the following things in mind: Your username can’t be used with Spotify again. You won't have access to your playlists, followers, and everything saved in Your Library . You’ll lose access to any purchased audiobooks if you close your account and delete your data. If you have the student discount , you won’t be able to apply it to another account until 12 months have elapsed since you signed up for it. If you do decide to close your account, you have up until 7 days to change your mind (to reactivate it, use the link in the email we sent you). Note that during this time, your playlists might still be visible to others. After that period, you won't be able to reactivate your account anymore. After 14 to 30 days your account will become fully anonymized and it won't be visible on the app anymore. Let's say you want any music transferred before deleting your account, in that case you can check out this Spotify Answer on how to do so 🙂 Didn't help?

      "Question: New account: transferring playlists, liked songs and followers\n",
      "Answer: You've created a new account and want to transfer your music and followers? Here's how you can do this: Playlists and Liked Songs: Make sure all your playlists in your old account are set to Public and have been added to your profile with these steps. You can also make a playlist called e.g. \"Your Music\" and copy all your Liked Song items there (for Windows, press Ctrl + a and for Mac, press Cmnd + a ) while in the 'Songs' section and drag them to the new playlist). Once you've confirmed all your playlists are public and added to your profile, log out of your old account. For the next steps, we'd recommend using a desktop device: Log in to your new account and search for your old account's profile. You can do so by typing spotify:user:username in the search bar (you need to replace username with your old account's username), or by searching for the Facebook name if the account is connected to Facebook. If you're having difficulties finding the account, you can get your profile link while logged in on the old account. Right click your name while on your profile page > Copy Link to profile. You can paste this in the search bar while on the new account and press Enter to load your old profile. Once you've located your old account's profile page, head to the tab Public Playlists . All your playlists should be displayed there. Click on a playlist, open it and select all the songs contained in it. Right-click the selected songs and click Add to Playlist > New Playlist. This step will create a new playlist to your new account containing the same songs. You can name the playlist the same name it had on the old account if you wish, or give it a different one. Repeat for all your playlists. Followers: While logged in the new account: Find the old account again (check out step 3 above). Tap the 'Followers' tab and then hit 'Follow' on all the artists and friends you wish to follow with the new account. Note : Keep in mind that your followers need to follow you back on the new account to see your activity. Didn't help?

      "Question: Playlists not fully syncing between devices, help?\n",
      "Answer: If you're seeing playlists or saved tracks on one device but not on another, first make sure you're logged in on the same account on both devices. If you are, try logging out and back in on the device that hasn't synced to shake things up. Make sure your apps are not in Offline Mode .

      "Question: Can I upgrade to Premium for Family or a Duo plan if I'm travelling abroad?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: All members of a Premium for Family or Duo plan must reside at the same physical address. Unfortunately, if you are currently travelling abroad and want to start one of those plans and invite members, it won't be possible. However, you can start your own plan as soon as you return home and send out invites for your friends and family to join. Alternatively, you can join someone else’s plan as soon as you return home.

      "Question: Disconnect Facebook from Spotify\n",
      "Answer: Answer: If you'd like to disconnect your Spotify account from Facebook, make sure to follow these steps: Desktop app Open the Spotify desktop app. In the top-right corner, click the arrow button next to your name , then Settings . Under Social , click DISCONNECT FROM FACEBOOK . Account page (PC and mobile) Open your account page . Go to Edit login methods. If your Spotify is connected to Facebook - you'll see Facebook under Current login methods. Screenshot for reference below: Click on Remove, once you do that you'll see the following message: Click on Yes, remove. Note: It’s not possible to complete these steps on the mobile app. If you want to reconnect to Facebook in future, you can connect it from the account page using browser. Don’t see this option? If you don't see this option it's either because your Facebook isn't connected to that account, but more likely that you created your Spotify account with Facebook at the beginning. If that's the case you have 3 options: 1. Deactivate your Facebook but continue to log into Spotify with the email and password you used for Facebook 2. Create a new Spotify account 3. Reactivate your Facebook Steps for option 1: Please note your displayed Spotify username will be a string of numbers instead of your display name.

You can continue to use the app as normal without a Facebook account. Steps for option 2: As your listening history will be lost we do not recommend this option. Your Spotify Discover Weekly, Release Radar etc will start from scratch. If your current account is on a Premium subscription, cancel it (you can resubscribe on your new account). Note: If you have the student discount , you won’t be able to apply it to your new account until the 12 months have elapsed since you signed up for it. Go to your account page and click SIGN OUT EVERYWHERE at the bottom. Create your new account . Note: It’s not possible to have two accounts with same email address.

Option 3: If you reactivate the Facebook account you used to sign up with Spotify you can also continue to use the app as normal. Didn't help?

      "Question: What are the rewards in the Spotify Stars Program?\n",
      "Answer: Ask any of the Stars, and they will tell you that being a part of the Spotify Star Program is its own reward. The Program brings testing opportunities, backstage info, and a general closeness to Spotify that can’t be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, there is much more than that! Rewards ensure that everyone in the program feels valued, motivated and appreciated for the effort put in. From the monthly calls with staff gaining insights and developing new skills, to the moments where you, a true ambassador, directly feel the joy of influencing how users experience Spotify. All of this, while holding in your hands some transferable skills and tools that help you to help and chat to your fellow users in the Community whilst you’re here, and can be used in many future life opportunities too! On top of these experiences, you can still expect branded swag flying your way from time to time on a surprise basis , especially if you’re amongst the Top Ten Contributors in the Program. Top contributor, you say? This is where our point system comes in. The more active you are, and the more high-quality engagements you provide - the more points you receive. In turn, they feed into our Star Leaderboard . The Leaderboard gets updated monthly, to let you know where you’re positioned, and show you that everything you do really counts! Some really love the competitive element, but rest assured it shouldn’t feel like a race, as mentioned quality is very much taken into consideration too. Using the points to make your way up the ranks also means you can earn a seat at our Star-only events. We usually host one virtual-only event per year, such as a week where we celebrate our values and get together as a team (and friends!). However, there’s one event that every Spotify Star looks forward to with a fire of excitement in their eyes - The Annual Spotify Star Jam ! Depending on the circumstances it’s either In Person or Virtual, and you’ll find this out from the Community team in the months leading to the event. In the first case, the top ten contributors get to visit one of Spotify’s head offices for the up close and personal all-expenses paid experience. If the Jam is Virtual, all of the Stars will be able to join online, but the top ten contributors get the chance to attend exclusive calls and meetings. Either way, you’ll be a part of these dedicated workshops, team-building activities, and Spotify calls! Let’s not forget that it’s our love for music that brought us to Spotify in the first place! In the spirit of this, you can also get your hands on Premium while you’re in the program. If you have been active and consistent enough with your post, you’ll be eligible for our Quarterly Free Premium initiative - one of the special perks of the Spotify Star Program. If your posts are not your gateway to this, don’t worry, as you can also redeem your points for Premium ( right now, this is only available for regular Premium prescriptions, we’re afraid we cannot offer Family, Student, or Duo plans ). Without further ado, here’s a summary of everything you can gain by being amongst the Spotify Star ranks: Monthly calls Backstage information A direct line of communication with Spotify staff Early features access and testing opportunities Participation in different projects Free Premium Your posts being featured on the Community home page Different roles, badges and forum permissions Surprise swag Taking part in awards ceremonies Events such as the Spotify Star Jam! Transferable skills for your CV/Resume Time with like-minded Spotify lovers! And our reward… is that you’re here! 🌟 Labels: Community Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

Click on your profile name on the top right of the page to bring up various account links. If messages are disabled, you should see an exclamation mark next to the \"mail\" icon Click on the icon to be taken directly to the Private Messenger settings. You will see a disclaimer with some information on the feature. 5.  If you're 18 years or over, you can choose Accept and then Confirm . Private messages will then be enabled and clicking on the mailbox icon will instead lead you to your inbox where you can read, reply and send PMs. If you ever change your mind and want to disable the feature, you can do so from you Community account settings.

      "Question: What do I need to join the Spotify Stars Program?\n",
      "Answer: You've probably spotted the Spotify Stars posting in this forum and wondered, 'what is a Star and how can I become one?'. We covered what the Stars are in this FAQ , so now's the time to cover the how. When you're applying for the program , the Community team will have a look at your application, and decide if you'd be a good candidate. Here are some examples of what we'll be looking for: Have you been in the Spotify Community long? Being a superuser in this forum and getting the advanced permissions that come with it means that you'll need to be familiar with how the Community works. A way we can tell this is if you've been actively a member of the Community for at least 3 months . That doesn't mean that if you've been here for less time your application will be rejected though! This is just a good starting point for us to see your activity over a period of time. If you're wondering where to start, check out this FAQ on navigating the Community . Do you already have helpful or engaging posts that we can look at? Stars are not just symbols in the sky - here they're Spotify Community users that go above and beyond! They help users, chat about all things music, and help Staff manage ideas. When you submit your application, we'll look into your Community posts to see if you've posted some consistently good posts. That can range from explaining Community functions to other users, helping with troubleshooting, linking to helpful resources or engaging with other Chat users. So, make sure you keep up with your posts! Are you over 18? At this time, we're only adding people over the age of 18 to the Program. If you're younger, you can always reapply at a later time! One last thing - at this time, we're only looking at applications submitted in English as it's the Community's officially supported language. We'll let you know if this changes in the future! *** Once you've submitted your application, the Community team will be reaching out via the Private Message function to let you know about the next steps. If you're over 18, make sure you have your Community PMs enabled so you don't miss it! Here's how to do that . Good luck and see you around the forums! Didn't help?

      "Question: What are different Community ranks and how can I rank up?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: So you discover the Spotify Community, start reading a bit and then you see it: all these username with different colors and names/ranks and they make no sense whatsoever. (Or maybe they do, in which case you can skip this post). What's a rank? Spoiler (Highlight to read) Lots, if not all, online forums, have some form of hierarchy of their users. That's called a ranking system . These systems exist because everyone can quickly get some idea of who this forum user is by their progression in the system. Someone could be a brand new forum user or a more experienced user. By seeing the rank title they have, the idea is that you'll be able to tell this yourself. In the Spotify Community, the first rank is Visitor . Community users can rank up to Composer , which is the highest rank they can achieve unless they join the Stars Program . Each rank comes with forum perks - but we'll leave you to discover these on your Community journey 😉 Lots, if not all, online forums, have some form of hierarchy of their users.That's called a ranking system.

Community user ranks: Visitor This is the first rank any brand new Community user gets Newbie The second next rank a user can achieve Casual Listener The next rank a user can level up to Regular The next rank a user can level up to Music Fan The next rank a user can level up to Gig Goer The next rank a user can level up to Roadie The next rank a user can level up to Songwriter The penultimate rank! If you made it this far, consider joining the Stars Program . Composer The highest rank a Community user can reach without joining the Stars Program . Community superuser ranks: Rising Star When a Community superuser joins the Stars Program , they'll start with this rank title. The Rising Star rank has multiple levels, starting with 1. The higher the level number, the more experience this superuser has. Spotify Star Spotify Star is the highest rank a superuser can get. Community Legend Legends are regular Community users who used to be Stars. They are no longer actively in the Star program but to honor their contributions, they get this special rank. Community Staff ranks: Spotify Community Manager Moderator These are some different roles of active Community Staff members. You can always differentiate them by the Spotify logo before their username. Spotify Legend Former Community Staff member Creator These are folks from our Creator teams, for example different Podcast teams. How can I rank up? Spoiler (Highlight to read) Now that you know the Community ranks are, the next question would be, how you can progress through these ranks. Well, we have a super secret formula that calculates and levels up users based on different factors. Note that these factors are all tied with your activity in the forum, not the Spotify app . An example could be: posting and helping in threads, discussing audio and podcasts, giving and receiving \"likes\" on helpful posts and good ideas, participating in the Idea Exchange, being a nice person, participating in Community events. Keep in mind that Staff ranks are not possible to achieve by ranking up as a regular user.

      "Question: Chat Guidelines\n",
      "Answer: Last updated : 3 May, 2021 What is Chat? Chat is a place for fans of Spotify to come together and celebrate the music and podcasts they’re listening to, with a specific focus on amplifying the voice of emerging artists. What are the six categories within Chat? Chat has six categories in which to put your posts : Music Exchange - Here you can s hare your current favorite tracks and create playlists together with others. Music Discussion - Let's dig deeper and discuss! What's so special about the music and artists you're most passionate about? Discovery & Promo - C elebrate the new and emerging artists you've never heard of. Тhis is where if you're an artist, you can promote your work! Or maybe you have just discovered a new artist that you want to showcase to others. Make sure to include some info about what makes them great. Social & Random - Music games, listening parties, fun chat and getting to know one another. App & Features - Tips to manage Your Library better and make the most of the app. Podcast Discussion - What are the shows and creators everyone should be paying attention to? Tip : Where available, you’ll be directed to the specific category guidelines if you click or tap the categories above - make sure to read through those before posting in the respective category! What should I (not) do as a user in Chat? To ensure the best Chat experience for yourself and all other users, keep in mind the following: Use the correct category when posting a new thread. Keep your posts relevant to the topic of the thread. Do not post the same track/playlist URI: more than once in the same thread; more than once in 10 days in Chat. Do not post anything that is for the purposes of commercial profit, including exchanges of favors, offering rewards, and transactional requests. Only post links to music or podcasts from channels other than Spotify if they are unavailable on Spotify. Tip : If the Community Moderators spot posts which do not observe the above guidelines, they may decide to move or remove such content. Remember that everything posted in Chat is also subject to the Spotify Community Guidelines . How should I use Chat as an artist or creator? You’re welcome to share your work with the Community using the Discovery & Promo label, bearing in mind the above guidelines. When doing so, make sure to tell us about yourself, the inspiration for your work, and what we can expect to hear - don’t just share a link! How do I help moderate Chat as the author of a thread? We place the responsibility on you as the author of the thread to make sure that users who post in your thread are adhering to the guidelines and are making a valuable contribution to your discussion. If a user posts something that seems irrelevant, we ask you to reply to them in the thread and try bringing them into the discussion. However, if the user ignores this and/or is spamming your thread, you can report them by following these steps: Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the post. Click Report Inappropriate Content in the drop-down menu. Write a short description on how the user is breaking the guidelines and/or write the number of the guideline being broken. Click NOTIFY MODERATOR . The Community Moderators will then take a closer look and follow up if the user has broken the guidelines. Labels: Community Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

Idea Exchange Guidelines : How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines : Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines : How does my feedback reach Spotify? The Idea Exchange is one of the most active areas of the Community. Many of you have questions about how the Ideas Exchange works, such as: Do ideas matter? How is an idea communicated to Spotify HQ? How do votes impact the outcome of an idea? How do you decide what to implement or close? We're here to help try and clear some of these questions up. The Community team produces reports on Ideas and passes them to the right teams at the right time.

Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? The Idea Exchange is one of the most active areas of the Spotify Community. It’s a place where Spotify users can share their feedback in the form of ideas, to improve the Spotify experience for everyone. Every user can suggest an idea or show their support for an existing one by voting for it! Requirements for ideas in the Idea Exchange: Ideas must follow the Spotify Community Guidelines. We don't tolerate any posts breaking our Community Guidelines , and that includes the Idea exchange. Ideas should be posted in English. This is the official language of the Community. One change request per Idea. When one post includes several feature requests, it becomes hard to keep track of and update them. If you have more than one idea, you can make a new idea submission for each one. This way we’ll know exactly which idea folks are voting for. Check if there's an existing idea. If there’s already a similar idea, you can add your vote to it or leave a comment to show your support. We will try to keep all feedback in one single place by merging similar ideas in one. Make sure your idea is clear. The more detailed your feature request is, the better! It’s easier for other users to know what you’re suggesting so they can add their support and feedback. It’s also easier for us to share updates and talk to the right teams at Spotify. Ideas without enough relevant details will be closed. We welcome you to submit a new one with more info. No requests for complete roll-backs. If you don’t like a certain update you’re welcome to let us know, constructively, how you feel about it. You could start a new topic in the relevant Help section and outline the things you agree or disagree with. This will likely also invite others to come and give their thoughts and now we’ll have a dialogue going. If you want to suggest specific feature changes, do feel free to submit one or even several ideas in the Exchange, just make sure you do it according to point 3. No pricing, subscription or content related requests. We do appreciate all the feedback you share with us but our Ideas board is to help us receive new product and feature suggestions that will allow us to improve our app and service for everyone. Changes to pricing, subscriptions or the content available are specific to each market around the world, and we cannot influence those. This includes requests for content removal or addition. No requests for availability in new countries. We’d love to have Spotify available everywhere. As in point 7, this is influenced by various factors and often we can’t share updates in advance about this. The best place to stay in the loop is the For the Record blog . > Important : Idea submissions that don’t meet the above requirements will be closed , so make sure to familiarize yourself with our guidelines before submitting your idea. How do I know if the idea already exists? You can check this by having a quick search in the Community here . If you find a similar idea, make sure to add your vote! > Tip : Try using keywords when searching for ideas. For example, if you have an idea around 'making it possible to play Spotify on multiple speakers at the same time, from one account' enter just a few keywords, like “multiple speakers account\". How do I make sure my idea is clear enough? A good starting point is a brief description of your current experience with the app. Once you covered the functionality of the app as it is right now, you can move on to explaining what exactly it is you would like to change. Avoid writing \"make this feature better\" as that could mean different things to different people, and instead try describing a specific improvement you’d like to see implemented and which section (Your Library, Home, Browse, artist pages, etc.) or platform (mobile, desktop, web player, speaker, etc.) this would affect. It can also be helpful to add screenshots or link to a related idea and explain in what way your idea is different. Here ’s a good example of a well structured idea you can use for reference: Spoiler (Highlight to read) 1. The heading has a clear call to action and has a label [in square brackets] 2.

      "Answer: This is part of a series of articles outlining how the Idea Exchange works: Idea Exchange Guidelines: What do I need to know before submitting? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? Ideas are moderated by Spotify Community Staff and our very own Community Stars . Sometimes, you’ll see that an idea's status has been changed to ‘Closed’ . This is because it didn’t meet one or more of the requirements of our Idea Exchange. It should also be noted that we cannot comment on third-party integrations, before they come out. For this reason we will generally set those ideas to \"Not Right Now\" at some point. Also, in some cases we can’t update the idea until it’s actually been implemented for a variety of reasons. As mentioned in article 1 your ideas can be merged with similar ideas on the topic. If you'd like to learn more about how your feedback reaches Spotify, have a look over here .

      "Question: Spotify® Support Community Guidelines\n",
      "Answer: Effective as from 26 September 2019 The integrity and safety of our Community and our users means a lot to us. In order to keep the Community as efficient and helpful as possible, we expect you to observe the Spotify Support Community Terms which includes the guidelines: Before searching for a thread related to your topic or posting a question regarding a problem, try reinstalling the Spotify application. Before posting or creating a new thread, make sure the issue you’re experiencing or the question you have is not already posted somewhere in the Community. Multiple threads on the same issue create clutter. Avoid double posting. Spotify will delete duplicate threads or posts on the same questions created by a user. Make sure that the thread you are posting on is relevant for your issue (for example, please do not post an iPhone related response on an Android related thread). Also, make sure that the thread is not outdated or relates to issues that have already been fixed or dealt with by Spotify. Please only post information relevant for the thread and avoid discussing personal matters or topics unrelated to Spotify services. Create a new thread or find another related thread if you have multiple queries. Do not add further queries to an existing thread. Be careful about the information that you post. Keep in mind that your posts will be available for all users of the Community. Always use an appropriate and respectful language when you post information in the Community. Avoid racist, sexist, abusive, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, threatening, obscene, condescending or otherwise offensive language that could be considered detrimental to other users, or Spotify employees or moderators. Do not post information or create threads for the promotion or advertisement of commercial products or services. Please do not post information such as name, address, personal identification number, social security number, email address, credit card information, or other personal information of you or other persons. Also make sure that you have all legal rights and/or consents to post any information or other material that you provide or link to through the Community. For obvious reasons, do not post links to malware, trojan viruses, or otherwise malicious content. Do not spam users via the blast of Private Messages tool in the Community. Do not run your own contests in this Community. Spotify employees and moderators will identify themselves in the Community by using the Spotify logo as avatars. Do not use any Spotify logo or trade name as your avatar or user name, or otherwise pose as a Spotify employee or moderator when posting in the Community. Do not post links to older or unofficial versions of the Spotify app. All users should only download the app from our official website. Please always be respectful when using the Community, and do not post of any Content which, in the sole discretion of Spotify: is offensive, abusive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, condescending; is illegal, or intended to promote or commit an illegal act of any kind, including but not limited to, violations of intellectual property rights, privacy rights or proprietary rights; includes personal data of third parties or is intended to solicit such personal data; includes malicious content, such as malware, trojan horses or viruses; includes your or any other user’s password; involves the transmission of unsolicited mass mailing or \"spamming\", or junk mail, chain letters or similar; involves commercial or sales activities, such as advertising, contests, sweepstakes, or pyramid schemes; links or references to commercial products or services; interferes with or disrupts the Community; or otherwise conflicts with the Community Terms or these Guidelines. Reporting inappropriate content If you receive a Private Message you think is inappropriate you can click Report at the bottom to let us know about it. If you see a community post you think is inappropriate you can click on the dots and then Report Inappropriate Content. Copyright © 2021 Spotify AB. All rights reserved.

      "Question: Sunsetting older app versions\n",
      "Answer: Hey folks, Starting January 15th, 2022, Spotify application versions that have been released before 2017 will no longer be supported. As a result, users who were still using the older versions of the application will not be able to log in to their accounts unless they upgrade to the latest Spotify app version. Spotify application versions from prior to 2017 on Android, iOS and desktop were missing certain features due to their outdated interface, and we made the decision to stop supporting them. If you were affected by this you will be receiving an email from us soon regarding this change. Affected users should update their Spotify to the latest version to keep using Spotify. Alternatively, you can use the Spotify Web Player from your supported web browser . For additional assistance or questions, please reach out to our Customer Support or visit our Support site .

      "Question: Local files sync and discovery on iOS\n",
      "Answer: Enjoy the audio files legally stored on your device in the app along with the rest of your Spotify library! You can either sync them from your computer to your iPhone/iPad or upload them directly to your iOS device's internal storage. Note: This article is intended for iOS users only. Desktop and Android users head here . Local files sync Sync a playlist that has local files in it from your PC to your iPhone/iPad! Here's how: Ensure that both devices are connected to the same network. Open the Spotify app and tap Settings (you can access them by going to your profile picture in the top left corner at the Home page and then tapping the Settings and privacy gear icon) . Scroll down to the Local Files option and toggle on Show audio files from this device . Note: A pop-up will ask permission to access your local network. Press OK to enable the transferring of local files between your PC and your iPhone/iPad. You can find this option in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network > Spotify in case you accidentally dismiss the pop-up or if it doesn't show up. Now go back to Your Library and download your playlist: the local files in it will sync over from your PC to your iPhone/iPad! Note: Local files sync is possible in some cases, but we cannot guarantee that it will work flawlessly across all devices. Local files discovery Play the audio files stored on your device and add them to your personal playlists! In order for the app to discover them, your files need to be added to the Spotify folder located in Files > On My iPhone/iPad . If you can't find the folder there, reboot your device and it should show up. Here are a few ways to upload them there: For Mac: Make sure that Show audio files from this device is toggled on in the app's Settings > Your Library > Show Local files (add your library) , and Spotify is allowed to access Media & Apple Music . You can check that in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security . Connect your iPhone/iPad to your computer via USB cable.

Click on File Sharing from the left side panel and select Spotify from the list of apps on the right, then click on Add files to upload your music. Once ready, select Sync and then Save to finalize the process. An alternative method that's also worth trying is syncing your Music Library instead. Check out Apple's guide on how to do that. You'll now find your tracks in the Local Files folder in Your Library . In case you already had some audio files stored on your iPhone/iPad that you'd like to listen to via the Spotify app, you'll need to move them to the Spotify folder located in Files > On My iPhone/iPad . If your music files are currently stored on a cloud, you'll have to download them to the Spotify folder in order for the app to discover them. Labels: App Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

      "Question: Shazam and Spotify\n",
      "Answer: Answer: As of writing this in March 2021, Shazam have released an updated version of their app for iOS, which as of version 14.2 has new features and functionalities. We wanted to share some info that we hope will clear up some questions and that you might find useful to get the best out of both apps. Can I connect Shazam to Spotify and how do I do that? The two apps can be connected so that you can get some extra benefits if using them together. In the Shazam app, go to Settings (available from Library ) and tap Connect . You'll need to authorize Spotify access to Shazam and you're done! Note: The Connect option is only shown in countries where Spotify is available. How do I automatically add my shazamed tracks to a Spotify playlist? Once connected, a playlist labeled My Shazam Tracks will be created in Spotify and all your subsequent Shazamed content will be automatically added. How do I add my Shazamed songs to other Spotify playlists? Tapping the Spotify Open button on any song in Shazam will open a search in Spotify and show you all the versions of that song. From there you can add the version of your choice to any Spotify playlist. Why can’t I connect Spotify to Shazam? / Why is there only Apple Music showing and not Spotify? The Connect option in the Shazam Settings will only be displayed in countries where Spotify is available. If you can't see the Spotify option on song pages in Shazam, go to Shazam Settings and make sure you’re connected. If you're having problems opening or syncing to Spotify, try disconnecting Spotify in Shazam Settings , restart both apps and then reconnect. Why wasn’t a 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist created when I turned on Sync? A playlist may fail to be created due to connection issues. Next time you Shazam a track we'll try and create the playlist again, and will add your latest Shazamed contents. Why wasn’t my latest shazamed track added to the 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist? There may've been a connection issue. When you next shazam a song, the playlist should update with your latest Shazams. If the issue persists, try the following steps: Make sure you're on the latest version of Shazam and Spotify Disconnect from Spotify in Shazam Settings Restart both apps Reconnect to Spotify I removed the \"My Shazam Tracks\" playlist. How can I get the tracks back? If you delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlists and then shazam a new track while connected to Spotify, a new playlist will be created. This overwrites the previous one and previous Shazams won't be re-added. As such, we advise not to delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlist, unless you want to move the existing tracks to other playlists and have already done so. What happens when I rename the My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify? If the My Shazam Tracks playlist is renamed while Sync Shazams to Spotify is turned on, a new My Shazam Tracks playlist will be created on your next Shazam. Any Shazams from that point onwards will be added to this newly created playlist. Where is the Add To button in Shazam? Following version 14.2 of Shazam, the Add To button has been removed, however the Open button has been improved with a more reliable search in Spotify. This means you can now add the song version of choice to any playlist in Spotify. Alternatively, if you want your new Shazams to be automatically added to a My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify, there's the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature.. Why are my past Shazams no longer syncing? Past Shazams will no longer sync to Spotify as part of the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature, however the syncing overall has been improved so you shouldn't have any issues to find and add more of your future Shazams to the My Shazam Tracks playlist. What about Shazam on Android? The new features and improved syncing are now available on the Android and iOS version of the app. Happy Shazaming! Didn't help?

      "Question: Manage Liked Songs\n",
      "Answer: Answer: When thinking of the ways to manage your Liked Songs , one of the most straightforward ideas would be to use the available Sort and Filter options. On the one hand, you can sort your Liked Songs according to each featured song’s title, artist, album, date (in terms of when it was added to the playlist), and duration. On the other hand, by using the option to filter, you can look up specific songs you might want to listen to without waiting for them to be eventually played as part of your queue. What is not as straightforward (and often overlooked) is the fact that, aside from using the Sort and Filter options separately, it’s possible to combine them . By doing so, you can manage your Liked Songs more efficiently and: Display all the songs from a particular artist in alphabetical order If you’d like to view and display all the songs from one specific artist in alphabetical order, tap Liked Songs > sort by Title > type the name of an artist in the search bar. Spot and remove duplicates If you sort your Liked Songs by Title and filter the results based on one artist’s name, all the “duplicates” (e.g. same audio with extremely similar or slightly different metadata) from the particular artist will also be displayed so you can remove them from the list.

How can I check which account I'm currently logged in? On mobile , you can do that by going to the app's Settings (you can access them by going to your profile picture in the top left corner and then tapping the Settings and privacy gear icon). On the top of the Settings page you'll see your subscription status. If you're on a PC/Mac you can click on your name in the upper-right corner > Account which will directly open up the account page for the currently logged in account. On this page you can see detailed information about your account, including your plan's current status.

If your account shows as free account in the app's Settings, but Your plan on your account page shows as Spotify Premium , it's recommended that you sign out and back into the app using the same login details you used for your account page to ensure that you're logged in to the Premium account. If Your plan also shows as Spotify free , then either your payment didn't go through or you most likely you signed up for Premium on another account. Check if you received a receipt  on your email when you signed up. If you didn't then it's worth trying to subscribe again. If  you did receive a receipt, there you'll find the username of the Premium account, a unique string of numbers and letters used to identify you on Spotify. Copy it and use it together with your password to log in. Should you need to reset your password, you can follow the steps in this article . Tip: At the bottom of every email sent by Spotify you'll also find the recipient's email address, so you can use the information to double-check if you were entering the correct email address during the login process.

      "Question: Can I upgrade to Premium for Family or a Duo plan if I'm travelling abroad?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: All members of a Premium for Family or Duo plan must reside at the same physical address. Unfortunately, if you are currently travelling abroad and want to start one of those plans and invite members, it won't be possible. However, you can start your own plan as soon as you return home and send out invites for your friends and family to join. Alternatively, you can join someone else’s plan as soon as you return home.

      "Question: Premium Family/Duo: only one person can listen at a time\n",
      "Answer: Each plan member needs to log in to their own Spotify account on their chosen device to listen. This means everyone gets their own playlists and saved music, and you don’t have to take turns or share login details. If you can't listen at the same time, someone's logged into the wrong account. They need to log out , then back in using the email address they used to join the plan. If you're the plan's manager (the person who started the plan) and your members haven't joined your plan from their own Spotify account yet, you'll need to follow the steps below: Go to the Family page / Duo page . On that page you can see an invite link to share with the person you want to add to your plan. There a several methods to choose from to share the invite link - just pick your preferred one. Invited members get a link to join, where they need to log in to their own account and verify their address . Tip : If they're accepting the invite on the same device it was sent from, the plan's manager who sent the invite should make sure they've logged out of their account first. If they didn't sign up for a Spotify account yet, they'll get prompted to make one when going through the steps once they click ACCEPT INVITE .

      "Question: Can I get Premium Family or Duo if I'm on an annual subscription?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Yes! You can start or join a Premium Family or Premium Duo plan right away, provided that your subscription was set up through Spotify directly. If you'd like to join a plan as a member , you can ask the plan's owner to send you an invitation  first. Once you join their plan, future payments will switch to the plan owner. Any remaining Premium time you have is forfeited. Further, if you want to start your own Premium Family or Duo plan and invite members, you also can! Keep in mind though that your next payment date will likely be earlier than it had been, due to the price difference between the plans. Didn't help?

      "Question: Why has my Premium subscription changed to free?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: The most common reason for your Premium subscription suddenly disappearing is due to having a second Spotify account created using Facebook. The best thing to try is logging out of Spotify, then back in using your email address and password. Avoid using the ‘Log in with Facebook’ button, as this will log you back into your Facebook-created account. If this works and you’re now seeing your Premium account, it’s worth closing your free account to avoid any confusion in the future. To confirm, you should see this (the Spotify Premium box under \"Your Plan\") in your Account overview if you're on Premium: If you’ve subscribed recently but you’re not get Premium, check out this Spotify Answer .

      "Question: Invoices for your Spotify Premium subscription\n",
      "Answer: As Spotify is for personal/non-commercial use, we only issue payment receipts. We don't issue invoices with a VAT number. However, we email a receipt to you at the beginning of your Premium trial, the first payment of a subscription, or when you purchase an e-card. You can also see a breakdown of the different taxes applied to your payment on that receipt. You should also receive email receipts for all your subsequent payments regardless of the subscription you use. If you haven’t received one, first make sure that you've provided the correct email address on your Account Overview page . Then, we'd suggest checking your spam/junk folder in case they were redirected there by mistake. If you still cannot find your receipts or if you cannot access them for other reasons (such as these being sent to a defunct address), you can also reach out to our support team and ask them to resend you all the receipts you need.

      "Question: Why am I still being charged after cancelling my subscription?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: If you get a Spotify charge after canceling your subscription, follow these steps: Log in to your account page . Click Subscription in the menu on the left. If your subscription status is Free, you may have a second account with Spotify. It's worth checking your email inboxes to see if you have any Spotify emails - that can mean that your extra account is registered with that email. If you don't have another email address, note how you log into the Spotify app usually: If you use your Facebook details try using the blue \"Log in with Facebook button.\" If you use your Spotify username try entering your username or email address. Once you've logged in, try the cancel process again and ensure you reach the final confirmation screen. Tip: If you subscribed through any other company than Spotify (for example your mobile or broadband company), you need to contact that company to cancel. For more info, check out this article .

      "Question: Improvements to Spotify Xbox Game Bar for Windows\n",
      "Answer: Hey everyone! We want to let you know that the Windows Store version of Spotify for Windows 1.1.94 comes with its own Xbox Game Bar widget, seamlessly replacing the one you are used to. What's new? The new Xbox Game Bar widget is always logged in to the same Spotify account that Spotify for Windows is logged in to. This means you never need to log in separately, and changing who's logged in to Spotify for Windows is constantly reflected. To use the new Xbox Game Bar widget, you now always have to run Spotify for Windows on the same PC. It can however be minimized to the taskbar or even to the system tray if you select \"Close button should minimize the Spotify Window\" in Preferences. You can of course still play via Spotify Connect just like before. Several bugs in the general user experience were fixed. The new Xbox Game Bar widget now comes in additional languages. Why are we doing this? The new version makes logging in much easier. The new version is now shipped in tandem with Spotify for Windows on Microsoft Store, making it easier for us to ship further improvements to the experience. Anything else? If you used the Xbox Game Bar widget previously, you have granted it access to your account. This is no longer needed and you can now revoke it by pressing Remove Access on Xbox Game Bar here . FAQ: I see an error message telling me to install the Spotify Widget: Spotify needs to be installed from the Microsoft Store to include the Xbox Game Bar widget. If you previously had downloaded Spotify via spotify.com, you will still have your settings, downloaded music and podcasts available to you. I see two Spotify Widgets: We're aware of this but it should be a very temporary phenomenon. The old widget will disappear after a while. The widget is stuck on the 'Start listening' screen: The Desktop app needs to be running, clicking the “Start Listening” button will launch it. If you are not logged into the Desktop app you will need to login and then bring the Game Bar up again with the Windows + G key command. Labels: Device Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

You can check the “Voice History” under “Activity” in the Amazon Alexa app to check if she heard you correctly and leave feedback whether she did what you wanted to improve your Alexa experience. Another important thing to note is that you must use the exact name of the playlist you want. Things that are likely to cause issues are usually playlists that contain punctuation, emojis, acronyms and initialisms (e.g. NASA and BBC) or other words that are just difficult to pronounce. The easiest way to deal with those is to rename the playlist from within Spotify. Note that Alexa might not be able to open newly/recently created playlists, because it can take time for Alexa to refresh your library of playlists. If you want to force it to find your new playlist immediately, try unlinking your Spotify in the Alexa app and then re-linking it (as described above). This should refresh the list of available playlists.

How to deal with tricky playlist names Spoiler (Highlight to read) Naturally, you can only rename the playlists you created yourself - So, what about those playlists that you’re following, whose names you cannot edit? One way to deal with this is to make a copy of the playlist and give it an easy to pronounce name that Alexa can understand. Keep in mind that your copied playlist won’t get any new songs added to the original, followed playlist, so we know this isn’t ideal. You can also try to create an Alexa Routine that triggers playback of the desired playlist.

Spoiler (Highlight to read) It’s currently not possible to link more than one Spotify account per Alexa account, but there’s a workaround that allows you to set up multiple Spotify accounts to work on your Alexa. You can add multiple accounts by setting up an Amazon Household . This way you can switch from one account to another just by talking to Alexa. For more details check out the related Amazon Help Topic here . Note that everyone who intends to use it will need to set up their own account with Amazon which in turn has to be linked to their own Spotify account using their own version of the app. Alternatively, you can use Spotify Connect without having to link your accounts, but if you don’t, you won’t have the full functionality of Alexa’s commands either and you'll have to use the Spotify app to choose your music. To do this, say \"Alexa, Spotify Connect\" to the specific speaker you want to listen to music on and follow the instructions that Alexa gives you (Open Spotify on your phone and select the playback device from the list). This allows you to play music from separate Spotify accounts on different speakers at the same time.

      "Answer: Answer: Power off your device It might sound basic, but some people over look this, and it can definitely help in some instances. To power off your PlayStation: Select the Power on/off button from the function screen, and then select Turn Off PS4/PS5. Press and hold the PS button on your controller for at least 1 second, and then select Turn Off PS4/PS5. Press and hold the power button for at least 7 seconds (until the system beeps twice). We’d also recommend unplugging your device and waiting for a few minutes before powering up again. Sign out of the PlayStation Network If you’re signed into the PlayStation Network, try signing out/back in again. Select Settings > PlayStation™Network/Account management > Sign Out. To sign back in, select Settings > PlayStation™Network/Account management > Sign In.

      "Question: Finding login details\n",
      "Answer: Answer: Not sure of your ID or you need a reminder of which email you used? Need those so you can reset your password ? There are different steps that you can follow in order to find your ID. The same goes for finding the email address on your account. Please note that a public display name is not the same as your ID. Newer Spotify accounts will also have unique, automatically generated IDs, rather than personally chosen usernames. This is also true if you've created your account through Facebook. Using the Spotify website or emails If you are already logged in on your browser, the easiest way is to head to your Account Overview page. Under \"Account\", go to \"Edit profile\". There you can find both your username along with the email address that is associated with your Spotify account. If your login session has ran out, another way is to check your email inbox for an email from Spotify. You receive emails from us on account creation, on payment or subscription changes or due to other important notifications. There should be information to which email address it was sent to at the bottom of the email body. Using the mobile app Open the app and click your profile picture at the top left of the screen. On the Settings and privacy button you can find different options that you can turn on and off as well as your associated email address. You can use that to reset your password if you don't know it, so you can find out your unique user ID on your profile page, as described above. But what if I can't access my account page or am not logged in? No worries, the below methods can still work, even if you're not logged in anywhere on Spotify. You might need the help of another friend who can perform a search on Spotify though. Using profile links With the help from a friend or a family member's account, you can search for your name in the app and you can get a link that includes your ID. On Desktop Find your profile via search and click on the three-dots menu in the top right corner. Then you can click on Copy link to profile . When you paste the link, the part that comes after \" user/ \" and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. In our example the link looks like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \", but take note that this can be just an auto generated ID. For example, for profile: https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e, the ID is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". On Mobile Same as on desktop, find your profile via the search function. Click on the three dot menu in the right corner and choose Share . When you copy and paste the link, the part that comes after \" user/ \" and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. As with our example for desktop, the link will look like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \". If you have an auto-generated ID, the link will look  like: https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e , and the ID here is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". Using the cache files on a PC, Mac or Android device This method can be handy if you're using one of the below devices and haven't deleted any temporary files yet. Windows Navigate to the folder C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\Roaming. A quick way to do so is to type in %AppData% (Percentage symbols included) in the search bar of your start menu/taskbar and press Enter. Look for a Spotify folder. If you find it, open it up. You should see a subfolder \"Users\" in there. In that folder will be all the usernames that you've logged in with on this device. Sometimes, the folders could be located in C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\ Local . If that's the case, just, navigate one folder up from Roaming and switch to the Local folder. Then repeat step 2. Mac Open Finder on your Mac. Click Go > Library in the menu bar. (You may need to hold the Alt key if Library isn't visible.) Open Application Support > Spotify > Users. Here you’ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. Android Connect your phone to a computer with a USB cable. Alternatively, you can use a file manager on your phone. Find and open the directory Android > data > com.spotify.music > files > spotifycache > users. Here you’ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. If you still can't find the username or the email address after giving these steps a go, you can reach out to our support team. The folks there will be happy to assist with further help. Didn't help?

      "Question: Email Verification FAQ\n",
      "Answer: We'd like to share some useful info and provide some help regarding the verification emails you've received. In essence, you will be prompted to send an email to yourself so that you can open it and successfully conclude the verification to continue using your Spotify app. The process looks like this : You will see in-app prompts with a button and a link which you can click on to send yourself the verification email. The email address which the verification email will be sent to will be displayed in the prompt. There is also an option to edit the email address if needed. Here's what you can do if you encounter any issues: I use an old email and can't access my email address. If you know your Spotify password you can still update your email from your account page , even if you get blocked as part of the process. After updating it, you'll automatically receive a new verification email to the new address. Click on the link there and you're good! My registered Spotify email is no longer valid. What should I do now? You can edit the email address the verification is sent to from the prompts you receive. Just click the Edit email address button. Once a new email has been saved, the verification email will be sent. I got blocked. I want to update my email address and verify the new one. Can I do it on a PC/Mac? Yes, you can still update your email address from any browser by going to your account overview page and clicking Edit Profile. This will re-send a verification email, so you can verify. I never received the verification email. What is going on? This could be due to a couple of reasons: 1) Emails from Spotify are blocked by your email provider. We suggest switching your email like described above to an alternative one, from another provider. 2) You have a filter set up that is automatically hiding the email. T ry adjusting these filters. If you have a Gmail account, this can be done as follows: Open Gmail (best on a PC/Mac). At the top right, click Settings (the gear icon) > See all settings > Click Filters and Blocked Addresses > Check if Spotify is listed.

      "Question: Solve the \"Email is taken\" Issue\n",
      "Answer: Answer Sometimes, when trying to update settings (country, birth date etc.) on your Spotify account page, you might get an error message saying \"Email is taken.\" even if you didn't try to update your email address. If you did try to update your email but you're getting that message, I'd recommend you try following the \"Another account is using my email address\" section of this support article . However, sometimes you might get this message even if you didn't try to update your email address. This issue happens because a few years ago it was possible to create more than one account with the same email address, so if you have two accounts with the same email address, you won't be able to change it back because there would still be an account with that email address. To solve this issue, you can change the email address to a different one. However, if you'd like to change the email address back to the desired one, I'd recommend you try to do a password reset with the \"taken\" email address that you don't use and close any account that might pop up. That should enable you to change the email address back to the desired one. It's important to check the account you're closing is not the one you currently use. This should help clear things up! However, if you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask other users in the help boards . Labels: Account Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

      "Question: Find out if you have another Spotify account\n",
      "Answer: It's very easy to register for a Spotify account. Missing playlists or music from your account? Seeing charges for your Premium but when you log in, your account is on free? I f you're having troubles like these, we'd recommend first taking a look for any additional accounts you may have with us. It's possible your missing playlists or subscription are in there 🙂 There are several ways you can use to locate a Spotify account: 1. Check your email addresses Enter any email addresses you use into our password reset form . If there's an account associated with it, we’ll let you know in your email inbox. Tip: you can look for an email with the subject “Reset your password” and then follow the steps to recover your account . Check your email inboxes, including any spam or junk folders, for emails from Spotify. If you have any, it’s likely there’s an account associated with that email address. Once you've checked your email addresses and found any of the above, you can use that email address to log in. If you aren't sure of your account's password, continue to reset the account’s password , then use that email address and the new password to log in. 2. Check Facebook It's also possible to register for a Spotify account using your Facebook credentials. To check if you have a Spotify account connected to Facebook: Log into Facebook and select Settings on the dropdown in the top-right. Choose Apps and Websites . If you see the Spotify icon, you have a Spotify account connected to Facebook. If you find Spotify listed in your apps, you can access that Spotify account by choosing LOG IN WITH FACEBOOK in the login page. If you'd like to go on using Spotify without Facebook or have deactivated Facebook, we'd suggest taking a look at this Spotify Answer for more info. Keep in mind that you can also sign up for Spotify using a phone number, Apple , or Google . Try logging in to the account page with these options. 3.

      "Question: Numeric/Alphanumeric usernames\n",
      "Answer: A lot of users have an account created via Facebook. It's fast, it's easy and it doesn't require a lot of steps because the required info to sign up for a Spotify account is being read from the Facebook profile used when signing up. The most important info being: Your Facebook display name Facebook profile picture And your Facebook Friends It's possible to sign up for an account with your Facebook profile, and at a later stage to opt out from sharing your Facebook information with us. This will result in some changes in your Spotify account, most notably the following: Your display name will change into your alphanumeric username Your profile picture won't be visible on your Spotify account You won't be able to find Facebook friends on Spotify Note that these changes don't necessarily happen instantly as the Facebook synchronization can take up to 48 hours. Keep in mind that you can set up a new display name at any point using this guide. This is the name that your friends will see and which can be used to search for your profile. You can't however log in to the app with your display name. You will have to enter either your username or your registered email address next time you log in. If you add a new Spotify display name while your account is still connected to Facebook, it will replace your Facebook name. If you'd like to see your name and profile picture in Spotify again, you can l og in on our website and go to Privacy Settings . Check if you have opted out of Spotify processing your Facebook data. Be sure that you have not opted out if you want to have your name and profile picture visible in Spotify. It should look like this: On Facebooks end it's also possible to prevent certain info from being shared with Spotify. So if you've opted back in but certain info, for example your list with Facebook friends is still missing, log in here and find Spotify in the list with apps. Click on 'View and edit' and you'll get the following screen: In this screen you can further decide which information you'd like to share with Spotify. Once again, keep in mind that it can take up to 48 hours before changes take effect. You might need to log out and back in as well. Didn't help?

      "Question: Close/delete your Spotify Account\n",
      "Answer: Maybe you have a duplicate account, maybe you just need a break from Spotify or you want to start fresh with a new account? No hard feelings! In case you just want to stop paying, you can cancel your Premium plan and use Spotify free instead. If you don't have Premium you can close your account permanently yourself. Just log in here and continue through the steps. Keep the following things in mind: Your username can’t be used with Spotify again. You won't have access to your playlists, followers, and everything saved in Your Library . You’ll lose access to any purchased audiobooks if you close your account and delete your data. If you have the student discount , you won’t be able to apply it to another account until 12 months have elapsed since you signed up for it. If you do decide to close your account, you have up until 7 days to change your mind (to reactivate it, use the link in the email we sent you). Note that during this time, your playlists might still be visible to others. After that period, you won't be able to reactivate your account anymore. After 14 to 30 days your account will become fully anonymized and it won't be visible on the app anymore.

      "Question: New account: transferring playlists, liked songs and followers\n",
      "Answer: You've created a new account and want to transfer your music and followers? Here's how you can do this: Playlists and Liked Songs: Make sure all your playlists in your old account are set to Public and have been added to your profile with these steps. You can also make a playlist called e.g. \"Your Music\" and copy all your Liked Song items there (for Windows, press Ctrl + a and for Mac, press Cmnd + a ) while in the 'Songs' section and drag them to the new playlist). Once you've confirmed all your playlists are public and added to your profile, log out of your old account. For the next steps, we'd recommend using a desktop device: Log in to your new account and search for your old account's profile. You can do so by typing spotify:user:username in the search bar (you need to replace username with your old account's username), or by searching for the Facebook name if the account is connected to Facebook. If you're having difficulties finding the account, you can get your profile link while logged in on the old account. Right click your name while on your profile page > Copy Link to profile. You can paste this in the search bar while on the new account and press Enter to load your old profile. Once you've located your old account's profile page, head to the tab Public Playlists . All your playlists should be displayed there. Click on a playlist, open it and select all the songs contained in it. Right-click the selected songs and click Add to Playlist > New Playlist. This step will create a new playlist to your new account containing the same songs. You can name the playlist the same name it had on the old account if you wish, or give it a different one. Repeat for all your playlists. Followers: While logged in the new account: Find the old account again (check out step 3 above). Tap the 'Followers' tab and then hit 'Follow' on all the artists and friends you wish to follow with the new account. Note : Keep in mind that your followers need to follow you back on the new account to see your activity. Didn't help?

If you don't see this option it's either because your Facebook isn't connected to that account, but more likely that you created your Spotify account with Facebook at the beginning. If that's the case you have 3 options: 1. Deactivate your Facebook but continue to log into Spotify with the email and password you used for Facebook 2. Create a new Spotify account 3.

      "Question: What are the rewards in the Spotify Stars Program?\n",
      "Answer: Ask any of the Stars, and they will tell you that being a part of the Spotify Star Program is its own reward. The Program brings testing opportunities, backstage info, and a general closeness to Spotify that can’t be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, there is much more than that! Rewards ensure that everyone in the program feels valued, motivated and appreciated for the effort put in. From the monthly calls with staff gaining insights and developing new skills, to the moments where you, a true ambassador, directly feel the joy of influencing how users experience Spotify. All of this, while holding in your hands some transferable skills and tools that help you to help and chat to your fellow users in the Community whilst you’re here, and can be used in many future life opportunities too! On top of these experiences, you can still expect branded swag flying your way from time to time on a surprise basis , especially if you’re amongst the Top Ten Contributors in the Program. Top contributor, you say? This is where our point system comes in. The more active you are, and the more high-quality engagements you provide - the more points you receive. In turn, they feed into our Star Leaderboard . The Leaderboard gets updated monthly, to let you know where you’re positioned, and show you that everything you do really counts! Some really love the competitive element, but rest assured it shouldn’t feel like a race, as mentioned quality is very much taken into consideration too. Using the points to make your way up the ranks also means you can earn a seat at our Star-only events. We usually host one virtual-only event per year, such as a week where we celebrate our values and get together as a team (and friends!). However, there’s one event that every Spotify Star looks forward to with a fire of excitement in their eyes - The Annual Spotify Star Jam ! Depending on the circumstances it’s either In Person or Virtual, and you’ll find this out from the Community team in the months leading to the event. In the first case, the top ten contributors get to visit one of Spotify’s head offices for the up close and personal all-expenses paid experience. If the Jam is Virtual, all of the Stars will be able to join online, but the top ten contributors get the chance to attend exclusive calls and meetings.

      "Question: What do I need to join the Spotify Stars Program?\n",
      "Answer: You've probably spotted the Spotify Stars posting in this forum and wondered, 'what is a Star and how can I become one?'. We covered what the Stars are in this FAQ , so now's the time to cover the how. When you're applying for the program , the Community team will have a look at your application, and decide if you'd be a good candidate. Here are some examples of what we'll be looking for: Have you been in the Spotify Community long? Being a superuser in this forum and getting the advanced permissions that come with it means that you'll need to be familiar with how the Community works. A way we can tell this is if you've been actively a member of the Community for at least 3 months . That doesn't mean that if you've been here for less time your application will be rejected though! This is just a good starting point for us to see your activity over a period of time. If you're wondering where to start, check out this FAQ on navigating the Community . Do you already have helpful or engaging posts that we can look at? Stars are not just symbols in the sky - here they're Spotify Community users that go above and beyond! They help users, chat about all things music, and help Staff manage ideas. When you submit your application, we'll look into your Community posts to see if you've posted some consistently good posts. That can range from explaining Community functions to other users, helping with troubleshooting, linking to helpful resources or engaging with other Chat users. So, make sure you keep up with your posts! Are you over 18? At this time, we're only adding people over the age of 18 to the Program. If you're younger, you can always reapply at a later time! One last thing - at this time, we're only looking at applications submitted in English as it's the Community's officially supported language. We'll let you know if this changes in the future! *** Once you've submitted your application, the Community team will be reaching out via the Private Message function to let you know about the next steps. If you're over 18, make sure you have your Community PMs enabled so you don't miss it! Here's how to do that . Good luck and see you around the forums! Didn't help?

      "Answer: Answer: So you discover the Spotify Community, start reading a bit and then you see it: all these username with different colors and names/ranks and they make no sense whatsoever. (Or maybe they do, in which case you can skip this post). What's a rank? Spoiler (Highlight to read) Lots, if not all, online forums, have some form of hierarchy of their users. That's called a ranking system . These systems exist because everyone can quickly get some idea of who this forum user is by their progression in the system. Someone could be a brand new forum user or a more experienced user. By seeing the rank title they have, the idea is that you'll be able to tell this yourself. In the Spotify Community, the first rank is Visitor . Community users can rank up to Composer , which is the highest rank they can achieve unless they join the Stars Program . Each rank comes with forum perks - but we'll leave you to discover these on your Community journey 😉 Lots, if not all, online forums, have some form of hierarchy of their users.That's called a ranking system.

If you made it this far, consider joining the Stars Program . Composer The highest rank a Community user can reach without joining the Stars Program . Community superuser ranks: Rising Star When a Community superuser joins the Stars Program , they'll start with this rank title. The Rising Star rank has multiple levels, starting with 1. The higher the level number, the more experience this superuser has. Spotify Star Spotify Star is the highest rank a superuser can get. Community Legend Legends are regular Community users who used to be Stars. They are no longer actively in the Star program but to honor their contributions, they get this special rank. Community Staff ranks: Spotify Community Manager Moderator These are some different roles of active Community Staff members. You can always differentiate them by the Spotify logo before their username. Spotify Legend Former Community Staff member Creator These are folks from our Creator teams, for example different Podcast teams. How can I rank up? Spoiler (Highlight to read) Now that you know the Community ranks are, the next question would be, how you can progress through these ranks. Well, we have a super secret formula that calculates and levels up users based on different factors. Note that these factors are all tied with your activity in the forum, not the Spotify app . An example could be: posting and helping in threads, discussing audio and podcasts, giving and receiving \"likes\" on helpful posts and good ideas, participating in the Idea Exchange, being a nice person, participating in Community events. Keep in mind that Staff ranks are not possible to achieve by ranking up as a regular user.

      "Question: Chat Guidelines\n",
      "Answer: Last updated : 3 May, 2021 What is Chat? Chat is a place for fans of Spotify to come together and celebrate the music and podcasts they’re listening to, with a specific focus on amplifying the voice of emerging artists. What are the six categories within Chat? Chat has six categories in which to put your posts : Music Exchange - Here you can s hare your current favorite tracks and create playlists together with others. Music Discussion - Let's dig deeper and discuss! What's so special about the music and artists you're most passionate about? Discovery & Promo - C elebrate the new and emerging artists you've never heard of. Тhis is where if you're an artist, you can promote your work! Or maybe you have just discovered a new artist that you want to showcase to others. Make sure to include some info about what makes them great. Social & Random - Music games, listening parties, fun chat and getting to know one another. App & Features - Tips to manage Your Library better and make the most of the app. Podcast Discussion - What are the shows and creators everyone should be paying attention to? Tip : Where available, you’ll be directed to the specific category guidelines if you click or tap the categories above - make sure to read through those before posting in the respective category! What should I (not) do as a user in Chat? To ensure the best Chat experience for yourself and all other users, keep in mind the following: Use the correct category when posting a new thread. Keep your posts relevant to the topic of the thread. Do not post the same track/playlist URI: more than once in the same thread; more than once in 10 days in Chat. Do not post anything that is for the purposes of commercial profit, including exchanges of favors, offering rewards, and transactional requests. Only post links to music or podcasts from channels other than Spotify if they are unavailable on Spotify. Tip : If the Community Moderators spot posts which do not observe the above guidelines, they may decide to move or remove such content. Remember that everything posted in Chat is also subject to the Spotify Community Guidelines . How should I use Chat as an artist or creator? You’re welcome to share your work with the Community using the Discovery & Promo label, bearing in mind the above guidelines. When doing so, make sure to tell us about yourself, the inspiration for your work, and what we can expect to hear - don’t just share a link! How do I help moderate Chat as the author of a thread? We place the responsibility on you as the author of the thread to make sure that users who post in your thread are adhering to the guidelines and are making a valuable contribution to your discussion. If a user posts something that seems irrelevant, we ask you to reply to them in the thread and try bringing them into the discussion. However, if the user ignores this and/or is spamming your thread, you can report them by following these steps: Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the post. Click Report Inappropriate Content in the drop-down menu. Write a short description on how the user is breaking the guidelines and/or write the number of the guideline being broken. Click NOTIFY MODERATOR . The Community Moderators will then take a closer look and follow up if the user has broken the guidelines. Labels: Community Help [ Direct article link ]\n",

Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? The Idea Exchange is one of the most active areas of the Spotify Community. It’s a place where Spotify users can share their feedback in the form of ideas, to improve the Spotify experience for everyone. Every user can suggest an idea or show their support for an existing one by voting for it! Requirements for ideas in the Idea Exchange: Ideas must follow the Spotify Community Guidelines. We don't tolerate any posts breaking our Community Guidelines , and that includes the Idea exchange. Ideas should be posted in English. This is the official language of the Community. One change request per Idea. When one post includes several feature requests, it becomes hard to keep track of and update them. If you have more than one idea, you can make a new idea submission for each one. This way we’ll know exactly which idea folks are voting for. Check if there's an existing idea. If there’s already a similar idea, you can add your vote to it or leave a comment to show your support. We will try to keep all feedback in one single place by merging similar ideas in one. Make sure your idea is clear. The more detailed your feature request is, the better! It’s easier for other users to know what you’re suggesting so they can add their support and feedback. It’s also easier for us to share updates and talk to the right teams at Spotify. Ideas without enough relevant details will be closed. We welcome you to submit a new one with more info. No requests for complete roll-backs. If you don’t like a certain update you’re welcome to let us know, constructively, how you feel about it. You could start a new topic in the relevant Help section and outline the things you agree or disagree with. This will likely also invite others to come and give their thoughts and now we’ll have a dialogue going. If you want to suggest specific feature changes, do feel free to submit one or even several ideas in the Exchange, just make sure you do it according to point 3. No pricing, subscription or content related requests. We do appreciate all the feedback you share with us but our Ideas board is to help us receive new product and feature suggestions that will allow us to improve our app and service for everyone. Changes to pricing, subscriptions or the content available are specific to each market around the world, and we cannot influence those. This includes requests for content removal or addition. No requests for availability in new countries. We’d love to have Spotify available everywhere. As in point 7, this is influenced by various factors and often we can’t share updates in advance about this. The best place to stay in the loop is the For the Record blog . > Important : Idea submissions that don’t meet the above requirements will be closed , so make sure to familiarize yourself with our guidelines before submitting your idea. How do I know if the idea already exists? You can check this by having a quick search in the Community here . If you find a similar idea, make sure to add your vote! > Tip : Try using keywords when searching for ideas. For example, if you have an idea around 'making it possible to play Spotify on multiple speakers at the same time, from one account' enter just a few keywords, like “multiple speakers account\". How do I make sure my idea is clear enough? A good starting point is a brief description of your current experience with the app. Once you covered the functionality of the app as it is right now, you can move on to explaining what exactly it is you would like to change. Avoid writing \"make this feature better\" as that could mean different things to different people, and instead try describing a specific improvement you’d like to see implemented and which section (Your Library, Home, Browse, artist pages, etc.) or platform (mobile, desktop, web player, speaker, etc.) this would affect. It can also be helpful to add screenshots or link to a related idea and explain in what way your idea is different. Here ’s a good example of a well structured idea you can use for reference: Spoiler (Highlight to read) 1. The heading has a clear call to action and has a label [in square brackets] 2. The first half of the body describes the current behavior of the app 3. The second half of the body makes a clear suggestion for improvement 1. The heading has a clear call to action and has a label [in square brackets]2. The first half of the body describes the current behavior of the app3. The second half of the body makes a clear suggestion for improvement If you’re all set to submit your own idea, you can follow this short guide on how to go about posting an idea and read more about what happens to it after it’s been submitted .

      "Question: Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed?\n",
      "Answer: This is part of a series of articles outlining how the Idea Exchange works: Idea Exchange Guidelines: What do I need to know before submitting? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? Ideas are moderated by Spotify Community Staff and our very own Community Stars . Sometimes, you’ll see that an idea's status has been changed to ‘Closed’ . This is because it didn’t meet one or more of the requirements of our Idea Exchange. It should also be noted that we cannot comment on third-party integrations, before they come out. For this reason we will generally set those ideas to \"Not Right Now\" at some point. Also, in some cases we can’t update the idea until it’s actually been implemented for a variety of reasons. As mentioned in article 1 your ideas can be merged with similar ideas on the topic. If you'd like to learn more about how your feedback reaches Spotify, have a look over here .

      "Question: Spotify® Support Community Guidelines\n",
      "Answer: Effective as from 26 September 2019 The integrity and safety of our Community and our users means a lot to us. In order to keep the Community as efficient and helpful as possible, we expect you to observe the Spotify Support Community Terms which includes the guidelines: Before searching for a thread related to your topic or posting a question regarding a problem, try reinstalling the Spotify application. Before posting or creating a new thread, make sure the issue you’re experiencing or the question you have is not already posted somewhere in the Community. Multiple threads on the same issue create clutter. Avoid double posting. Spotify will delete duplicate threads or posts on the same questions created by a user. Make sure that the thread you are posting on is relevant for your issue (for example, please do not post an iPhone related response on an Android related thread). Also, make sure that the thread is not outdated or relates to issues that have already been fixed or dealt with by Spotify. Please only post information relevant for the thread and avoid discussing personal matters or topics unrelated to Spotify services. Create a new thread or find another related thread if you have multiple queries. Do not add further queries to an existing thread. Be careful about the information that you post. Keep in mind that your posts will be available for all users of the Community. Always use an appropriate and respectful language when you post information in the Community. Avoid racist, sexist, abusive, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, threatening, obscene, condescending or otherwise offensive language that could be considered detrimental to other users, or Spotify employees or moderators. Do not post information or create threads for the promotion or advertisement of commercial products or services. Please do not post information such as name, address, personal identification number, social security number, email address, credit card information, or other personal information of you or other persons. Also make sure that you have all legal rights and/or consents to post any information or other material that you provide or link to through the Community. For obvious reasons, do not post links to malware, trojan viruses, or otherwise malicious content. Do not spam users via the blast of Private Messages tool in the Community. Do not run your own contests in this Community. Spotify employees and moderators will identify themselves in the Community by using the Spotify logo as avatars. Do not use any Spotify logo or trade name as your avatar or user name, or otherwise pose as a Spotify employee or moderator when posting in the Community. Do not post links to older or unofficial versions of the Spotify app. All users should only download the app from our official website. Please always be respectful when using the Community, and do not post of any Content which, in the sole discretion of Spotify: is offensive, abusive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, condescending; is illegal, or intended to promote or commit an illegal act of any kind, including but not limited to, violations of intellectual property rights, privacy rights or proprietary rights; includes personal data of third parties or is intended to solicit such personal data; includes malicious content, such as malware, trojan horses or viruses; includes your or any other user’s password; involves the transmission of unsolicited mass mailing or \"spamming\", or junk mail, chain letters or similar; involves commercial or sales activities, such as advertising, contests, sweepstakes, or pyramid schemes; links or references to commercial products or services; interferes with or disrupts the Community; or otherwise conflicts with the Community Terms or these Guidelines. Reporting inappropriate content If you receive a Private Message you think is inappropriate you can click Report at the bottom to let us know about it. If you see a community post you think is inappropriate you can click on the dots and then Report Inappropriate Content. Copyright © 2021 Spotify AB. All rights reserved.

      "Can I upgrade to Premium for Family or a Duo plan if I'm travelling abroad? Answer: All members of a Premium for Family or Duo plan must reside at the same physical address.

To accept the invite, you must live at the same address as the plan manager, make sure you're logged in to your own Spotify account and provide the correct address by either using location services or entering it manually. How does the billing work? Spotify only charges the plan manager, never the invited members. If you see unexpected charges, you can check our guide for finding any additional accounts . The full amount is being charged monthly, regardless of if members join. If you've already subscribed for Premium with us, your billing will switch automatically and you won’t need to cancel anything. If you subscribed to Premium before becoming a member of a Family plan, your plan will be automatically cancelled once you join. As mentioned above, the manager will be the only one charged for the Family plan. Keep in mind that if your current Premium plan is associated with a partner, you first need to cancel with them and wait for your current Premium to end. What features does the plan offer? Change address . If you move or the wrong details were entered at signup, the plan manager can change the address by logging in to their Family page . Existing members may be asked to confirm the new address to continue using the plan. Blend - which offers users a similar experience to the features of the now deprecated Family mix but with expanded capabilities, including an unlimited number of playlists and up to 10 different participants on each. Manage explicit content . The plan manager can choose to allow or block content marked as explicit for each member of the plan. Keep in mind that our explicit tags are based on information we receive from the rights-holders. It’s possible some explicit content may not be tagged, so won’t be blocked from playing with these steps. Users can switch between different Premium Family or Premium Duo plans, but only once in 12 months. If you try switching more than once, you’ll get an error message saying You can’t join this plan . If the plan manager decides to switch between Family and/or Duo, this doesn’t affect the invited members and is considered the same plan. The 12 months start counting from the first time a user switched plans. Didn't help? Search for more Spotify Answers, or create a new thread and ask the Community.
