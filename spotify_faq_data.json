        "question": "Sunsetting older app versions",
        "answer": "Hey folks, Starting January 15th, 2022, Spotify application versions that have been released before 2017 will no longer be supported. As a result, users who were still using the older versions of the application will not be able to log in to their accounts unless they upgrade to the latest Spotify app version. Spotify application versions from prior to 2017 on Android, iOS and desktop were missing certain features due to their outdated interface, and we made the decision to stop supporting them. If you were affected by this you will be receiving an email from us soon regarding this change. Affected users should update their Spotify to the latest version to keep using Spotify. Alternatively, you can use the Spotify Web Player from your supported web browser . For additional assistance or questions, please reach out to our Customer Support or visit our Support site .

        "question": "Shazam and Spotify",
        "answer": "Answer: As of writing this in March 2021, Shazam have released an updated version of their app for iOS, which as of version 14.2 has new features and functionalities. We wanted to share some info that we hope will clear up some questions and that you might find useful to get the best out of both apps. Can I connect Shazam to Spotify and how do I do that? The two apps can be connected so that you can get some extra benefits if using them together. In the Shazam app, go to Settings (available from Library ) and tap Connect . You'll need to authorize Spotify access to Shazam and you're done! Note: The Connect option is only shown in countries where Spotify is available. How do I automatically add my shazamed tracks to a Spotify playlist? Once connected, a\u00a0playlist labeled My Shazam Tracks will be created in Spotify and all your subsequent Shazamed content will be automatically added. How do I add my Shazamed songs to other Spotify playlists? Tapping the Spotify Open button on any song in Shazam will open a search in Spotify and show you all the versions of that song. From there you can add the version of your choice to any Spotify playlist. Why can\u2019t I connect Spotify to Shazam? / Why is there only Apple Music showing and not Spotify? The Connect option in the Shazam Settings will only be displayed in countries where Spotify is available. If you can't see the Spotify option on song pages in Shazam, go to Shazam Settings and make sure you\u2019re connected. If you're having problems opening or syncing to Spotify, try disconnecting Spotify in Shazam Settings , restart both apps and then reconnect. Why wasn\u2019t a 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist created when I turned on Sync? A playlist may fail to be created due to connection issues. Next time you Shazam a track we'll try and create the playlist again, and will add your latest Shazamed contents. Why wasn\u2019t my latest shazamed track added to the 'My Shazam Tracks' playlist? There may've been a connection issue. When you next shazam a song, the playlist should update with your latest Shazams. If the issue persists, try the following steps: Make sure you're on the latest version of Shazam and Spotify Disconnect from Spotify in Shazam Settings Restart both apps Reconnect to Spotify I removed the \"My Shazam Tracks\" playlist. How can I get the tracks back? If you delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlists and then shazam a new track while connected to Spotify, a new playlist will be created. This overwrites the previous one and previous Shazams won't be re-added. As such, we advise not to delete your existing My Shazam Tracks playlist, unless you want to move the existing tracks to other playlists and have already done so. What happens when I rename the My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify? If the My Shazam Tracks playlist is renamed while Sync Shazams to Spotify is turned on, a new My Shazam Tracks playlist will be created on your next Shazam. Any Shazams from that point onwards will be added to this newly created playlist. Where is the Add To button in Shazam? Following version 14.2 of Shazam, the Add To button has been removed, however the Open button has been improved with a more reliable search in Spotify. This means you can now add the song version of choice to any playlist in Spotify. Alternatively, if you want your new Shazams to be automatically added to a My Shazam Tracks playlist in Spotify, there's the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature.. Why are my past Shazams no longer syncing? Past Shazams will no longer sync to Spotify as part of the Sync Shazams to Spotify feature, however the syncing overall has been improved so you shouldn't have any issues to find and add more of your future Shazams to the My Shazam Tracks playlist. What about Shazam on Android? The new features and improved syncing are now available on the Android and iOS version of the app. Happy Shazaming! Didn't help?

        "question": "Manage Liked Songs",
        "answer": "Answer: When thinking of the ways to manage your Liked Songs , one of the most straightforward ideas would be to use the available Sort and Filter options. On the one hand, you can sort your Liked Songs according to each featured song\u2019s title, artist, album, date (in terms of when it was added to the playlist), and duration. On the other hand, by using the option to filter, you can look up specific songs you might want to listen to without waiting for them to be eventually played as part of your queue. What is not as straightforward (and often overlooked) is the fact that, aside from using the Sort and Filter options separately, it\u2019s possible to combine them . By doing so, you can manage your Liked Songs more efficiently and: Display all the songs from a particular artist in alphabetical order If you\u2019d like to view and display all the songs from one specific artist in alphabetical order, tap Liked Songs > sort by Title > type the name of an artist in the search bar. Spot and remove duplicates If you sort your Liked Songs by Title and filter the results based on one artist\u2019s name, all the \u201cduplicates\u201d (e.g. same audio with extremely similar or slightly different metadata) from the particular artist will also be displayed so you can remove them from the list.

        "question": "Improvements to Spotify Xbox Game Bar for Windows",
        "answer": "Hey everyone! We want to let you know that the Windows Store version of Spotify for Windows 1.1.94 comes with its own Xbox Game Bar widget, seamlessly replacing the one you are used to. What's new? The new Xbox Game Bar widget is always logged in to the same Spotify account that Spotify for Windows is logged in to. This means you never need to log in separately, and changing who's logged in to Spotify for Windows is constantly reflected. To use the new Xbox Game Bar widget, you now always have to run Spotify for Windows on the same PC. It can however be minimized to the taskbar or even to the system tray if you select \"Close button should minimize the Spotify Window\" in Preferences. You can of course still play via Spotify Connect just like before. Several bugs in the general user experience were fixed. The new Xbox Game Bar widget now comes in additional languages. Why are we doing this? The new version makes logging in much easier. The new version is now shipped in tandem with Spotify for Windows on Microsoft Store, making it easier for us to ship further improvements to the experience. Anything else? If you used the Xbox Game Bar widget previously, you have granted it access to your account. This is no longer needed and you can now revoke it by pressing Remove Access on Xbox Game Bar here . FAQ: I see an error message telling me to install the Spotify Widget: Spotify needs to be installed from the Microsoft Store to include the Xbox Game Bar widget. If you previously had downloaded Spotify via spotify.com, you will still have your settings, downloaded music and podcasts available to you. I see two Spotify Widgets: We're aware of this but it should be a very temporary phenomenon. The old widget will disappear after a while. The widget is stuck on the 'Start listening' screen: The Desktop app needs to be running, clicking the \u201cStart Listening\u201d button will launch it. If you are not logged into the Desktop app you will need to login and then bring the Game Bar up again with the Windows + G key command. Labels: Device Help [ Direct article link ]"

The easiest way to deal with those is to rename the playlist from within Spotify.

One way to deal with this is to make a copy of the playlist and give it an easy to pronounce name that Alexa can understand. Keep in mind that your copied playlist won\u2019t get any new songs added to the original, followed playlist, so we know this isn\u2019t ideal. You can also try to create an Alexa Routine that triggers playback of the desired playlist. Once you have your routine set up, you can simply say: \u201cAlexa, playlist.\u201d and the favorite one will start automatically.

Spoiler (Highlight to read) It\u2019s currently not possible to link more than one Spotify account per Alexa account, but there\u2019s a workaround that allows you to set up multiple Spotify accounts to work on your Alexa. You can add multiple accounts by setting up an Amazon Household . This way you can switch from one account to another just by talking to Alexa. For more details check out the related Amazon Help Topic here . Note that everyone who intends to use it will need to set up their own account with Amazon which in turn has to be linked to their own Spotify account using their own version of the app. Alternatively, you can use Spotify Connect without having to link your accounts, but if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t have the full functionality of Alexa\u2019s commands either and you'll have to use the Spotify app to choose your music. To do this, say \"Alexa, Spotify Connect\" to the specific speaker you want to listen to music on and follow the instructions that Alexa gives you (Open Spotify on your phone and select the playback device from the list). This allows you to play music from separate Spotify accounts on different speakers at the same time. Tip: It\u2019s best to keep Spotify closed when you use the \"Spotify Connect\" command, then open Spotify when she tells you to. If you don't, the connection between Spotify app and your speaker isn't always made.

        "question": "Finding login details",
        "answer": "Answer: Not sure of your ID or you need a reminder of which email you used? Need those so you can reset your password ? There are different steps that you can follow in order to find your ID. The same goes for finding the email address on your account. Please note that a public display name is not the same as your ID. Newer Spotify accounts will also have unique, automatically generated IDs, rather than personally chosen usernames. This is also true if you've created your account through Facebook. Using the Spotify website or emails If you are already logged in on your browser, the easiest way is to head to your Account Overview page. Under \"Account\", go to \"Edit profile\". There you can find both your username along with the email address that is associated with your Spotify account. If your login session has ran out, another way is to check your email inbox for an email from Spotify. You receive emails from us on account creation, on payment or subscription changes or due to other important notifications. There should be information to which email address it was sent to at the bottom of the email body. Using the mobile app Open the app and click your profile picture at the top left of the screen. On the Settings\u00a0and privacy button you can find different options that you can turn on and off as well as your associated email address. You can use that to reset your password if you don't know it, so you can find out your unique user ID on your profile page, as described above. But what if I can't access my account page or am not logged in? No worries, the below methods can still work, even if you're not logged in anywhere on Spotify. You might need the help of another friend who can perform a search on Spotify though. Using profile links With the help from a friend or a family member's account, you can search for your name in the app and you can get a link that includes your ID. On Desktop Find your profile via search and click on the three-dots menu in the top right corner. Then you can click on Copy link to profile . When you paste the link,\u00a0the part that comes after \" user/ \"\u00a0and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. In our example the link looks like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \", but take note that this can be just an auto generated ID. For example, for profile:\u00a0https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e, the ID is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". On Mobile Same as on desktop, find your profile via the search function. Click on the three dot menu in the right corner and choose Share . When you copy and paste the link,\u00a0the part that comes after \" user/ \"\u00a0and before \" ?si=\" is your ID. As with our example for desktop, the link will look like https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares?si=f64035f8cadf423b and the ID is \" spotifycares \". If you have an auto-generated ID, the link will look\u00a0 like: https://open.spotify.com/user/j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x?si=2f0851eed94f4c7e , and the ID here is \" j7ss9vdqts9dji9qudk5y9q5x \". Using the cache files on a PC, Mac or Android device This method can be handy if you're using one of the below devices and haven't deleted any temporary files yet. Windows Navigate to the folder C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\Roaming. A quick way to do so is to type in %AppData% (Percentage symbols included) in the search bar of your start menu/taskbar and press Enter. Look for a Spotify folder. If you find it, open it up. You should see a subfolder \"Users\" in there. In that folder will be all the usernames that you've logged in with on this device. Sometimes, the folders could be located in\u00a0C:\\Users\\Your PC username\\App Data\\ Local . If that's the case, just, navigate one folder up from Roaming and switch to the Local folder. Then repeat step 2. Mac Open Finder on your Mac. Click Go > Library in the menu bar. (You may need to hold the Alt key if Library isn't visible.) Open Application Support > Spotify > Users. Here you\u2019ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. Android Connect your phone to a computer with a USB cable. Alternatively, you can use a file manager on your phone. Find and open the directory Android > data > com.spotify.music > files > spotifycache > users. Here you\u2019ll see all the usernames you've logged in with on this device. If you still can't find the username or the email address after giving these steps a go, you can reach out to our support team. The folks there will be happy to assist with further help. Didn't help?

        "question": "Email Verification FAQ",
        "answer": "We'd like to share some useful info and provide some help regarding the verification emails you've received. In essence, you will be prompted to send an email to yourself so that you can open it and successfully conclude the verification to continue using your Spotify app. The process looks like this : You will see in-app prompts with a button and a link which you can click on to send yourself the verification email. The email address which the verification email will be sent to will be displayed in the prompt. There is also an option to edit the email address if needed. Here's what you can do if you encounter any issues: I use an old email and can't access my email address. If you know your Spotify password you can still update your email from your account page , even if you get blocked as part of the process. After updating it, you'll automatically receive a new verification email to the new address. Click on the link there and you're good! My registered Spotify email is no longer valid. What should I do now? You can edit the email address the verification is sent to from the prompts you receive. Just click the Edit email address button. Once a new email has been saved, the verification email will be sent. I got blocked. I want to update my email address and verify the new one. Can I do it on a PC/Mac? Yes, you can still update your email address from any browser by going to your account overview page and clicking Edit Profile. This will re-send a verification email, so you can verify. I never received the verification email. What is going on? This could be due to a couple of reasons: 1) Emails from Spotify are blocked by your email provider. We suggest switching your email like described above to an alternative one, from another provider. 2) You have a filter set up that is automatically hiding the email. T ry adjusting these filters. If you have a Gmail account, this can be done as follows: Open Gmail (best on a PC/Mac). At the top right, click Settings (the gear icon) > See all settings > Click Filters and Blocked Addresses > Check if Spotify is listed.

        "question": "Solve the \"Email is taken\" Issue",
        "answer": "Answer Sometimes, when trying to update settings (country, birth date etc.) on your Spotify account page, you might get an error message saying \"Email is taken.\" even if you didn't try to update your email address. If you did try to update your email but you're getting that message, I'd recommend you try following the \"Another account is using my email address\" section of this support article . However, sometimes you might get this message even if you didn't try to update your email address. This issue happens because a few years ago it was possible to create more than one account with the same email address, so if you have two accounts with the same email address, you won't be able to change it back because there would still be an account with that email address. To solve this issue, you can change the email address to a different one. However, if you'd like to change the email address back to the desired one, I'd recommend you try to do a password reset with the \"taken\" email address that you don't use and close any account that might pop up. That should enable you to change the email address back to the desired one. It's important to check the account you're closing is not the one you currently use. This should help clear things up!

You can do so by typing spotify:user:username in the search bar (you need to replace username with your old account's username), or by searching for the Facebook name if the account is connected to Facebook. If you're having difficulties finding the account, you can get your profile link while logged in on the old account. Right click your name while on your profile page > Copy Link to profile. You can paste this in the search bar while on the new account and press Enter to load your old profile. Once you've located your old account's profile page, head to the tab Public Playlists . All your playlists should be displayed there. Click on a playlist, open it and select all the songs contained in it. Right-click the selected songs and click Add to Playlist > New Playlist. This step will create a new playlist to your new account containing the same songs.\u00a0You can name the playlist the same name it had on the old account if you wish, or give it a different one. Repeat for all your playlists. Followers: While logged in the new account: Find the old account again (check out step 3 above). Tap the 'Followers' tab and then hit 'Follow' on all the\u00a0artists and friends you wish to follow with the new account. Note : Keep in mind that\u00a0your followers need to follow you back on the new account to see your activity. Didn't help?

        "question": "Disconnect Facebook from Spotify",
        "answer": "Answer: If you'd like to disconnect your Spotify account from Facebook, make sure to follow these steps: Desktop app Open the Spotify desktop app. In the top-right corner, click the arrow button next to your name , then Settings . Under Social , click DISCONNECT FROM FACEBOOK . Account page (PC and mobile) Open your account page . Go to Edit login methods. If your Spotify is connected to Facebook - you'll see Facebook under Current login methods. Screenshot for reference below: Click on Remove, once you do that you'll see the following message: Click on Yes, remove. Note: It\u2019s not possible to complete these steps on the mobile app. If you want to reconnect to Facebook in future, you can connect it from the account page using browser. Don\u2019t see this option? If you don't see this option it's either because your Facebook isn't connected to that account, but more likely that you created your Spotify account with Facebook at the beginning. If that's the case you have 3 options: 1. Deactivate your Facebook but continue to log into Spotify with the\u00a0email and password you used for Facebook 2. Create a new Spotify account 3. Reactivate your Facebook Steps for option 1: Please note your displayed Spotify username will be a string of numbers\u00a0instead of your display name. Deactivate your Facebook Reset your password by entering the email address that was registered on your Facebook account Open the Spotify app Enter the email address and the new password (you cannot select the Log in with Facebook option any longer). You can continue to use the app as normal without a Facebook account. Steps for option 2: As your listening history will be lost we do not recommend this option. Your Spotify Discover Weekly, Release Radar etc will\u00a0start from scratch. If your current account is on a Premium subscription, cancel it (you can resubscribe on your new account). Note: If you have the student discount , you won\u2019t be able to apply it to your new account until the 12 months have elapsed since you signed up for it. Go to your account page and click SIGN OUT EVERYWHERE at the bottom. Create your new account . Note: It\u2019s not possible to have two accounts with same email address. If you\u2019d like to keep the email address associated with your old account, you first need to close the old account . Any saved music and playlists will still be on your old account, but you can save / create them again on your new account with these steps . Option 3: If you reactivate the Facebook account you used to sign up with Spotify you can also continue to use the app as normal. Didn't help?

        "question": "What are the rewards in the Spotify Stars Program?",
        "answer": "Ask any of the Stars, and they will tell you that being a part of the Spotify Star Program is its own reward. The Program brings testing opportunities, backstage info, and a general closeness to Spotify that can\u2019t be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, there is much more than that! Rewards ensure that everyone in the program feels valued, motivated and appreciated for the effort put in. From the monthly calls with staff gaining insights and developing new skills, to the moments where you, a true ambassador, directly feel the joy of influencing how users experience Spotify. All of this, while holding in your hands some transferable skills and tools that help you to help and chat to your fellow users in the Community whilst you\u2019re here, and can be used in many future life opportunities too! On top of these experiences, you can still expect branded swag flying your way from time to time on a surprise basis , especially if you\u2019re amongst the Top Ten Contributors in the Program. Top contributor, you say? This is where our point system comes in. The more active you are, and the more high-quality engagements you provide - the more points you receive. In turn, they feed into our Star Leaderboard . The Leaderboard gets updated monthly, to let you know where you\u2019re positioned, and show you that everything you do really counts! Some really love the competitive element, but rest assured it shouldn\u2019t feel like a race, as mentioned quality is very much taken into consideration too. Using the points to make your way up the ranks also means you can earn a seat at our Star-only events. We usually host one virtual-only event per year, such as a week where we celebrate our values and get together as a team (and friends!). However, there\u2019s one event that every Spotify Star looks forward to with a fire of excitement in their eyes - The Annual Spotify Star Jam ! Depending on the circumstances it\u2019s either In Person or Virtual, and you\u2019ll find this out from the Community team in the months leading to the event. In the first case, the top ten contributors get to visit one of Spotify\u2019s head offices for the up close and personal all-expenses paid experience. If the Jam is Virtual, all of the Stars will be able to join online, but the top ten contributors get the chance to attend exclusive calls and meetings. Either way, you\u2019ll be a part of these dedicated workshops, team-building activities, and Spotify calls! Let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s our love for music that brought us to Spotify in the first place! In the spirit of this, you can also get your hands on Premium while you\u2019re in the program. If you have been active and consistent enough with your post, you\u2019ll be eligible for our Quarterly Free Premium initiative - one of the special perks of the Spotify Star Program. If your posts are not your gateway to this, don\u2019t worry, as you can also redeem your points for Premium ( right now, this is only available for regular Premium prescriptions, we\u2019re afraid we cannot offer Family, Student, or Duo plans ). Without further ado, here\u2019s a summary of everything you can gain by being amongst the Spotify Star ranks: Monthly calls Backstage information A direct line of communication with Spotify staff Early features access and testing opportunities Participation in different projects Free Premium Your posts being featured on the Community home page Different roles, badges and forum permissions Surprise swag Taking part in awards ceremonies Events such as the Spotify Star Jam! Transferable skills for your CV/Resume Time with like-minded Spotify lovers! And our reward\u2026 is that you\u2019re here! \ud83c\udf1f Labels: Community Help [ Direct article link ]"

Remember, regular Community users can rank up to Composer, which is the highest rank they can achieve unless they join the Stars Program. When you join the program, you can then progress through the superuser ranks. Didn't help? Search for more FAQs, or create a new thread and ask the Community.

        "question": "Chat Guidelines",
        "answer": "Last updated : 3 May, 2021 What is Chat? Chat is a place for fans of Spotify to come together and celebrate the music and podcasts they\u2019re listening to, with a specific focus on amplifying the voice of emerging artists. What are the six categories within Chat? Chat has six categories in which to put your posts : Music Exchange - Here you can s hare your current favorite tracks and create playlists together with others. Music Discussion - Let's dig deeper and discuss! What's so special about the music and artists you're most passionate about? Discovery & Promo - C elebrate the new and emerging artists you've never heard of. \u0422his is where if you're an artist, you can promote your work! Or maybe you have just discovered a new artist that you want to showcase to others. Make sure to include some info about what makes them great. Social & Random - Music games, listening parties, fun chat and getting to know one another. App & Features - Tips to manage Your Library better and make the most of the app. Podcast Discussion - What are the shows and creators everyone should be paying attention to? Tip : Where available, you\u2019ll be directed to the specific category guidelines if you click or tap the categories above - make sure to read through those before posting in the respective category! What should I (not) do as a user in Chat? To ensure the best Chat experience for yourself and all other users, keep in mind the following: Use the correct category when posting a new thread. Keep your posts relevant to the topic of the thread. Do not post the same track/playlist URI: more than once in the same thread; more than once in 10 days in Chat. Do not post anything that is for the purposes of commercial profit, including exchanges of favors, offering rewards, and transactional requests. Only post links to music or podcasts from channels other than Spotify if they are unavailable on Spotify. Tip : If the Community Moderators spot posts which do not observe the above guidelines, they may decide to move or remove such content. Remember that everything posted in Chat is also subject to the Spotify Community Guidelines . How should I use Chat as an artist or creator? You\u2019re welcome to share your work with the Community using the Discovery & Promo label, bearing in mind the above guidelines. When doing so, make sure to tell us about yourself, the inspiration for your work, and what we can expect to hear - don\u2019t just share a link! How do I help moderate Chat as the author of a thread? We place the responsibility on you as the author of the thread to make sure that users who post in your thread are adhering to the guidelines and are making a valuable contribution to your discussion. If a user posts something that seems irrelevant, we ask you to reply to them in the thread and try bringing them into the discussion. However, if the user ignores this and/or is spamming your thread, you can report them by following these steps: Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the post. Click Report Inappropriate Content in the drop-down menu. Write a short description on how the user is breaking the guidelines and/or write the number of the guideline being broken. Click NOTIFY MODERATOR . The Community Moderators will then take a closer look and follow up if the user has broken the guidelines. Labels: Community Help [ Direct article link ]"

Idea Exchange Guidelines : How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines : Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines : How does my feedback reach Spotify? The Idea Exchange is one of the most active areas of the Community. Many of you have questions about how the Ideas Exchange works, such as: Do ideas matter? How is an idea communicated to Spotify HQ? How do votes impact the outcome of an idea? How do you decide what to implement or close? We're here to help try and clear some of these questions up. The Community team produces reports on Ideas and passes them to the right teams at the right time. You can see one of the follow statuses for each idea: Live Idea Ideas that are open for voting and commenting. Under Consideration This feature is coming. We have a rough timeline for a release. After this stage there are usually 2 possible outcomes : Implemented This feature is rolled out. Yay! Not Right Now We talked about this internally but it\u2019s not on our timeline right now. That doesn't mean it never will be. Of course, votes are not the only deciding factors of what Spotify is going to do or not do next. We also have to consider the following: Helping artists. Data and other information we've collected. Information from research testing, focus groups, and surveys. Feedback in the Community and other support channels. Our overall short- and long-term business strategy. Further, if we build something that didn't originate from the Community, we'll take the time to announce it if a corresponding idea exists in the Community.

        "question": "Idea Exchange Guidelines: What do I need to know before submitting?",
        "answer": "This is part of a series of articles outlining how the Idea Exchange works: Idea\u00a0Exchange Guidelines: What do I need to know before submitting? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? The Idea Exchange is one of the most active areas of the Spotify Community. It\u2019s a place where Spotify users can share their feedback in the form of ideas, to improve the Spotify experience for everyone. Every user can suggest an idea or show their support for an existing one by voting for it! Requirements for ideas in the Idea Exchange: Ideas must follow the Spotify Community Guidelines. We don't tolerate any posts breaking our Community Guidelines , and that includes the Idea exchange. Ideas should be posted in English. This is the official language of the Community. One change request per Idea. When one post includes several feature requests, it becomes hard to keep track of and update them. If you have more than one idea, you can make a new idea submission for each one. This way we\u2019ll know exactly which idea folks are voting for. Check if there's an existing idea. If there\u2019s already a similar idea, you can add your vote to it or leave a comment to show your support. We will try to keep all feedback in one single place by merging similar ideas in one. Make sure your idea is clear. The more detailed your feature request is, the better! It\u2019s easier for other users to know what you\u2019re suggesting so they can add their support and feedback. It\u2019s also easier for us to share updates and talk to the right teams at Spotify. Ideas without enough relevant details will be closed. We welcome you to submit a new one with more info. No requests for complete roll-backs. If you don\u2019t like a certain update you\u2019re welcome to let us know, constructively, how you feel about it. You could start a new topic in the relevant Help section and outline the things you agree or disagree with. This will likely also invite others to come and give their thoughts and now we\u2019ll have a dialogue going. If you want to suggest specific feature changes, do feel free to submit one or even several ideas in the Exchange, just make sure you do it according to point 3. No pricing, subscription or content related requests. We do appreciate all the feedback you share with us but our Ideas board is to help us receive new product and feature suggestions that will allow us to improve our app and service for everyone. Changes to pricing, subscriptions or the content available are specific to each market around the world, and we cannot influence those.\u00a0This includes requests for content removal or addition. No requests for availability in new countries. We\u2019d love to have Spotify available everywhere. As in point 7, this is influenced by various factors and often we can\u2019t share updates in advance about this. The best place to stay in the loop is the For the Record blog . > Important : Idea submissions that don\u2019t meet the above requirements will be closed , so make sure to familiarize yourself with our guidelines before submitting your idea. How do I know if the idea already exists? You can check this by having a quick search in the Community here . If you find a similar idea, make sure to add your vote! > Tip : Try using keywords when searching for ideas. For example, if you have an idea around 'making it possible to play Spotify on multiple speakers at the same time, from one account' enter just a few keywords, like \u201cmultiple speakers account\". How do I make sure my idea is clear enough? A good starting point is a brief description of your current experience with the app. Once you covered the functionality of the app as it is right now, you can move on to explaining what exactly it is you would like to change. Avoid writing \"make this feature better\" as that could mean different things to different people, and instead try describing a specific improvement you\u2019d like to see implemented and which section (Your Library, Home, Browse, artist pages, etc.) or platform (mobile, desktop, web player, speaker, etc.) this would affect. It can also be helpful to add screenshots or link to a related idea and explain in what way your idea is different. Here \u2019s a good example of a well structured idea you can use for reference: Spoiler (Highlight to read) 1. The heading has a clear call to action and has a label [in square brackets] 2. The first half of the body describes the current behavior of the app 3. The second half of the body makes a clear suggestion for improvement 1.

Idea Exchange Guidelines: How can I submit an idea? What happens next? Idea Exchange Guidelines: Why was my idea closed? Idea Exchange Guidelines: How does my feedback reach Spotify? Ideas are moderated by Spotify Community Staff and our very own Community Stars . Sometimes, you\u2019ll see that an idea's status has been changed to \u2018Closed\u2019 . This is because it didn\u2019t meet one or more of the requirements of our Idea Exchange. It should also be noted that we cannot comment on third-party integrations, before they come out. For this reason we will generally set those ideas to \"Not Right Now\" at some point. Also, in some cases we can\u2019t update the idea until it\u2019s actually been implemented for a variety of reasons.

        "answer": "Effective as from\u00a026 September 2019 The integrity and safety of our Community and our users means a lot to us. In order to keep the Community as efficient and helpful as possible, we expect you to observe the Spotify Support Community Terms which includes the guidelines: Before searching for a thread related to your topic or posting a question regarding a problem, try reinstalling the Spotify application. Before posting or creating a new thread, make sure the issue you\u2019re experiencing or the question you have is not already posted somewhere in the Community. Multiple threads on the same issue create clutter. Avoid double posting. Spotify will delete duplicate threads or posts on the same questions created by a user. Make sure that the thread you are posting on is relevant for your issue (for example, please do not post an iPhone related response on an Android related thread). Also, make sure that the thread is not outdated or relates to issues that have already been fixed or dealt with by Spotify. Please only post information relevant for the thread and avoid discussing personal matters or topics unrelated to Spotify services. Create a new thread or find another related thread if you have multiple queries. Do not add further queries to an existing thread. Be careful about the information that you post. Keep in mind that your posts will be available for all users of the Community. Always use an appropriate and respectful language when you post information in the Community. Avoid racist, sexist, abusive, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, threatening, obscene, condescending\u00a0or otherwise offensive language that could be considered detrimental to other users, or Spotify employees or moderators. Do not post information or create threads for the promotion or advertisement of commercial products or services. Please do not post information such as name, address, personal identification number, social security number, email address, credit card information, or other personal information of you or other persons. Also make sure that you have all legal rights and/or consents to post any information or other material that you provide or link to through the Community. For obvious reasons, do not post links to malware, trojan viruses, or otherwise malicious content. Do not spam users via the blast of Private Messages tool in the Community. Do not run your own contests in this Community. Spotify employees and moderators will identify themselves in the Community by using the Spotify logo as avatars. Do not use any Spotify logo or trade name as your avatar or user name, or otherwise pose as a Spotify employee or moderator when posting in the Community.
